00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:14,210
my bad.

387
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:15,690
I thought you were my Dad.

388
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:16,660
Xuejiao,

389
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:18,180
since when are you nearsighted?

390
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:18,810
Why didn't I know that?

391
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:19,780
I'm trying to get

392
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:20,730
back to Class 1.

393
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:21,660
Studied too hard.

394
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,020
I'm going cross-eyed.

395
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:23,850
Weird.

396
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,380
She's been all about studying lately.

397
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:26,780
What's gotten into her?

398
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:27,900
Gu, hello,

399
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:29,420
I'm Tianyu's father.

400
00:14:29,710 --> 00:14:30,210
Yi Dafa.

401
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:30,850
Big...

402
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:31,970
Big projects, no sweat,

403
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:33,210
Yi Dafa's your bet!

404
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:35,570
Great kid,

405
00:14:35,710 --> 00:14:36,900
this kid's going places!

406
00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:38,900
Is this seat taken? Can I sit here?

407
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:39,810
Yes, you can.

408
00:14:43,470 --> 00:14:45,450
Back in the day,
whenever Yi Tianyu and I

409
00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:46,140
fought,

410
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,020
Dada always had my back.

411
00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:50,180
Dada,

412
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:52,090
you had your glory days.

413
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:58,450
Gu, where are your parents?

414
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,140
My parents...

415
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:06,260
Gone?

416
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:08,260
Don't say that.

417
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:23,260
You...

418
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,260
Your Dad looks so young!

419
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:28,420
I'm her Uncle.

420
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:29,570
Real Uncle.

421
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:31,850
Such a fine-looking

422
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:32,730
Uncle.

423
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,060
Here's my card.

424
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:35,690
Yi Dafa.

425
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:37,690
Thank you.

426
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:41,140
What made you change your mind

427
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:41,970
and come to my rescue?

428
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:43,210
Do you really wanna see me

429
00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:44,540
scolded in front of the whole class,

430
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:45,540
all helpless?

431
00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:46,450
Couldn't stand by.

432
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,490
Alright, parents,

433
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:49,490
well,

434
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,060
it's about time,

435
00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:51,970
please take your seats,

436
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:52,450
okay?

437
00:15:52,710 --> 00:15:53,540
And students,

438
00:15:53,590 --> 00:15:54,380
please go out.

439
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:55,850
Go on.

440
00:15:56,510 --> 00:15:57,260
Don't be glib.

441
00:15:57,710 --> 00:15:58,780
- Come on, hurry.
- Be nice.

442
00:15:59,200 --> 00:15:59,940
You're so getting scolded.

443
00:16:17,830 --> 00:16:18,210
Tianyu,

444
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:19,020
let's go play ball.

445
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:20,330
Not today.

446
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:21,690
Why not?

447
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,010
I have the ball here.

448
00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:26,380
My Dad still doesn't know

449
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:27,530
what I got last time.

450
00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:29,420
He's about to find out.

451
00:16:30,270 --> 00:16:31,250
What if he strokes out?

452
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:31,900
Right?

453
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:33,660
Okay,

454
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,450
I'll be here with you.

455
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:44,180
This parent meeting's gonna be...

456
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:44,730
Gu Xuejiao.

457
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:46,250
What?

458
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:47,580
Look.

459
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:48,340
Let's go.

460
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:51,180
Today's topic is simple,

461
00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:51,970
the college entrance exam.

462
00:16:51,990 --> 00:16:52,660
The Study God from No. 7 High

463
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,140
is actually your Uncle.

464
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:56,010
And you didn't tell me?

465
00:16:56,990 --> 00:16:58,690
He's just a stand-in today.

466
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,100
You got someone to pretend...?

467
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,490
A few days ago, we already

468
00:17:03,550 --> 00:17:04,860
had our prep rally.

469
00:17:05,310 --> 00:17:07,490
Some students' goals

470
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:08,660
are really ambitious.

471
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:10,580
Others are more realistic.

472
00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:12,380
I believe you parents

473
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:13,010
already have

474
00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:14,050
a clear sense

475
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:15,860
of what schools to aim for.

476
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:16,380
Right?

477
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:19,860
Goals? With 300-something scores?

478
00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:20,660
So, today,

479
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:22,340
if you have any questions,

480
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:23,340
I'm here to answer them,

481
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:24,010
sound good?

482
00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:25,140
Ma'am,

483
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:25,820
I heard someone

484
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:27,140
in our class is aiming
for Capital University?

485
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:29,180
Isn't that a bit much?

486
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:35,100
Having a major goal

487
00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:36,340
is already

488
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,100
half the battle won.

489
00:17:37,550 --> 00:17:38,620
Whose parent is that?

490
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:39,690
Looks so young.

491
00:17:44,070 --> 00:17:44,690
I don't know

492
00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:45,340
if you've heard about

493
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,250
the Zeigarnik Effect.

494
00:17:48,550 --> 00:17:50,100
Having a big goal

495
00:17:50,510 --> 00:17:51,900
helps push you forward

496
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:53,450
and increases your chances of success.

497
00:17:57,790 --> 00:17:58,420
So, I don't think

498
00:17:58,470 --> 00:17:59,210
it's laughable.

499
00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:01,730
In fact,

500
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:02,580
if every goal

501
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:03,730
were easy to reach,

502
00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:04,900
then life

503
00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:06,180
wouldn't be worth much.

504
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:13,940
Zeigarnik Effect.

505
00:18:14,550 --> 00:18:15,490
Whose parent is that?

506
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:16,490
So eloquent!

507
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:18,690
What eloquent?

508
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:19,380
Let's go.

509
00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:21,860
What about your Dad?

510
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:22,900
Forget it.

511
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:24,140
I just remembered,

512
00:18:24,310 --> 00:18:25,450
last time he beat me like crazy

513
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:26,140
without a break.

514
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:27,380
He's not gonna stoke out.

515
00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:28,250
He's right.

516
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:30,580
Big dreams need bold spirit.

517
00:18:30,790 --> 00:18:31,420
Aim high

518
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:32,770
to reach high.

519
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:34,010
Gotta write it down.

520
00:18:34,790 --> 00:18:35,490
I think this parent

521
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:37,730
made a very good point.

522
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:39,100
We often say,

523
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,940
parents' support
gives children strength to go far.

524
00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:43,490
Parents' vision

525
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:44,900
sets the child's horizon.

526
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:46,490
So, I believe,

527
00:18:46,550 --> 00:18:48,210
setting goals a bit higher

528
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:49,660
isn't necessarily a bad thing.

529
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,290
Your daughter Shiyun

530
00:18:51,550 --> 00:18:53,210
got the highest score
in English this time.

531
00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:54,970
So impressive.

532
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,420
What tutoring program is she in?

533
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:57,530
What?

534
00:18:58,070 --> 00:18:59,530
She doesn't go to any tutoring classes.

535
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:00,250
We've never

536
00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:01,420
interfered in her studies.

537
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:02,820
It's all her own effort.

538
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:05,010
What a brilliant kid.

539
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:05,900
Not just smart,

540
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:06,820
she's pretty too.

541
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:08,820
Must've taken after her Mom.

542
00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:10,180
You flatter me.

543
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:12,180
Yun.

544
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:13,250
Mom.

545
00:19:13,310 --> 00:19:14,420
We were just talking about you.

546
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:16,420
Helping the teacher again?

547
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:18,290
Alright.

548
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:19,620
We'll leave

549
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:20,690
you two to chat.

550
00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:21,490
See you around.

551
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:22,100
Okay,

552
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:23,010
see you around.

553
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,380
Bye bye.

554
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:24,970
Goodbye, Aunties.

555
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:25,660
Goodbye.

556
00:19:28,990 --> 00:19:30,250
Mom, I'm done over there too.

557
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:31,290
Wanna go home together?

558
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,180
Go home?

559
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,900
The gift for your teacher is in the car,

560
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:37,010
go grab it.

561
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,450
Out of all the subjects,

562
00:19:40,030 --> 00:19:41,490
only your English is decent.

563
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:43,420
All the money I spent on you

564
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:44,290
was for nothing.

565
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:02,250
Shiyun.

566
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:03,210
So?

567
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:04,340
Am I reliable or not?

568
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:05,940
What do you mean?

569
00:20:06,230 --> 00:20:07,100
That night,

570
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:08,620
I helped cover for you and Xuejiao.

571
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:09,900
I swear,

572
00:20:10,030 --> 00:20:10,660
it was a test

573
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:12,660
of both physical and mental strength.

574
00:20:12,990 --> 00:20:14,050
I was running back and forth

575
00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:15,010
between two rooms

576
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,050
and switching

577
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:17,050
between two genders.

578
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,140
You mean that night

579

Give him an inch, he takes a mile.

771
00:27:01,710 --> 00:27:01,940
Here.

772
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:02,770
Okay.

773
00:27:03,270 --> 00:27:03,730
Uncle Gu.

774
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:04,690
Gu.

775
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:06,620
Thank both of you.

776
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:07,490
Helped me big time.

777
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:08,860
Bye, Uncle.

778
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:09,140
Okay.

779
00:27:09,510 --> 00:27:09,900
Take care.

780
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:10,340
Bye bye.

781
00:27:14,070 --> 00:27:14,770
They're also calling me

782
00:27:14,790 --> 00:27:16,140
your "uncle".

783
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:17,900
When can we stop

784
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:19,050
being "relatives"?

785
00:27:21,510 --> 00:27:22,180
Soon, soon.

786
00:27:22,750 --> 00:27:24,290
They're just being friendly.

787
00:27:28,310 --> 00:27:29,050
What's the deal

788
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:29,820
with you and Yi Tianyu?

789
00:27:30,510 --> 00:27:31,380
What else could it be?

790
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:32,450
Just classmates.

791
00:27:33,510 --> 00:27:34,340
College entrance exam

792
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,050
is around the corner.

793
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:36,420
Don't get distracted.

794
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:39,730
You have nothing to worry about.

795
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:40,340
Lin.

796
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:41,620
I would never get distracted.

797
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:42,770
Better be.

798
00:27:43,270 --> 00:27:43,900
Go do your dictation.

799
00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:45,290
Hello.

800
00:27:45,550 --> 00:27:45,970
Hello.

801
00:27:46,070 --> 00:27:46,530
Can I order?

802
00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:48,770
- What would you like?
- A latte.

803
00:27:49,230 --> 00:27:49,690
25.

804
00:27:54,310 --> 00:27:55,290
If I had a daughter like that,

805
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:56,210
that'd be great.

806
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:57,970
Dad, you've got quite an eye.

807
00:27:58,710 --> 00:27:59,620
Your Dad's got

808
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:00,580
the sharpest eye in the world.

809
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,180
Just look at your Mom.

810
00:28:03,310 --> 00:28:04,450
I'm ranked last

811
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:05,620
in the whole school.

812
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:07,010
She's a bit better,

813
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:08,900
second to last.

814
00:28:12,030 --> 00:28:13,660
Why didn't you say so earlier?

815
00:28:16,270 --> 00:28:16,970
Is she like

816
00:28:17,310 --> 00:28:18,420
a plant from the bookstore?

817
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:19,140
No, no, no.

818
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:19,900
That's...

819
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:21,690
That's fine.

820
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,100
A head for business.

821
00:28:23,510 --> 00:28:24,900
She's got a bit of my style.

822
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:25,940
Nice.

823
00:28:26,710 --> 00:28:27,620
Doing business is good.

824
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:28,620
Okay.

825
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,180
As long as she can make money.

826
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,140
6003136

827
00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:41,770
6003134

828
00:28:44,550 --> 00:28:45,690
Pick whichever comes up.

829
00:28:52,510 --> 00:28:53,530
Wait.

830
00:28:54,510 --> 00:28:55,210
I've never guessed

831
00:28:55,270 --> 00:28:56,900
a multiple-choice question
right in my life.

832
00:28:58,750 --> 00:28:59,620
I need backup.

833
00:29:06,510 --> 00:29:07,530
Where are you sneaking off to?

834
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:09,970
Keep it down.

835
00:29:10,230 --> 00:29:11,210
I'll leave the door open for you.

836
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:12,770
Can you do me a favor?

837
00:29:17,070 --> 00:29:17,450
Brother,

838
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:18,530
you've got the worst luck.

839
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:20,380
Pick one

840
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:21,730
for Mom and Dad.

841
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:24,970
I've got bad luck?

842
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:27,690
You always miss
the college entrance score

843
00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:28,450
by one point.

844
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:29,490
You're like

845
00:29:29,550 --> 00:29:30,900
a walking bad luck charm.

846
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,050
Born for this.

847
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:33,530
Nope.

848
00:29:34,470 --> 00:29:35,210
Dad!

849
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:37,340
Alright, fine.

850
00:29:37,550 --> 00:29:38,250
I'll do it.

851
00:29:40,510 --> 00:29:41,100
This one.

852
00:29:43,510 --> 00:29:44,140
Bye bye.

853
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:50,450
6003136?

854
00:29:51,550 --> 00:29:52,900
Can you tell me which of these two

855
00:29:53,310 --> 00:29:55,290
shows signs of a big surge?

856
00:29:55,790 --> 00:29:56,450
This one.

857
00:29:56,450 --> 00:29:58,240
[Henglin Co., Ltd.
6003134]

858
00:29:59,790 --> 00:30:01,380
Two negatives make a positive.

859
00:30:02,230 --> 00:30:03,770
6003134

860
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:04,970
it is.

861
00:30:10,070 --> 00:30:11,050
Now that I've got a direction,

862
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:12,900
where do I get the money?

863
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:23,770
Who touched my code?

864
00:30:35,550 --> 00:30:36,100
So expensive.

865
00:30:48,750 --> 00:30:50,940
Turned out the thief is

866
00:30:51,070 --> 00:30:53,250
a bit closer to home.

867
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:55,770
Brother,

868
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,820
we're family, what's yours is mine.

869
00:30:59,270 --> 00:30:59,940
Besides,

870
00:31:00,470 --> 00:31:01,620
Roller Blast is shutting down

871
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:02,490
in a few years anyway.

872
00:31:02,790 --> 00:31:04,210
Those items of yours will

873
00:31:04,310 --> 00:31:05,660
just be digital junk by then.

874
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:09,530
What's mine is yours,

875
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:11,140
what's yours is for everyone.

876
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:14,530
What are you really up to?

877
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:18,340
I'm trying to make you rich.

878
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:23,490
All your gear

879
00:31:23,550 --> 00:31:24,580
sold for 8,000.

880
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:25,530
Plus

881
00:31:25,710 --> 00:31:27,900
my New Year's money, 3,000,

882
00:31:28,070 --> 00:31:29,010
we've got 11,000 total.

883
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,340
Only 8,000?

884
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:35,390
An anonymous account

885
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:36,180
posted this video

886
00:31:36,330 --> 00:31:37,630
on the school forum.

887
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:40,550
Anonymous?

888
00:31:40,610 --> 00:31:41,420
This video

889
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:42,180
basically

890
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:43,180
screams Chen Xiao.

891
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:44,420
Make sense.

892
00:31:44,850 --> 00:31:46,390
You ruined her plans twice.

893
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:47,180
Of course, she wants to

894
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:48,390
come for you.

895
00:31:48,570 --> 00:31:49,910
That's not the right mindset.

896
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:51,590
Sounds like victim-blaming to me.

897
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:53,790
It was self-defense.

898
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:54,940
They were at fault.

899
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:56,940
I don't know what victim-blaming is.

900
00:31:57,250 --> 00:31:57,790
Maybe

901
00:31:57,890 --> 00:31:59,020
we should just apologize.

902
00:31:59,040 --> 00:31:59,940
It might not be too late.

903
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:02,190
You know why

904
00:32:02,210 --> 00:32:03,270
people keep getting bullied?

905
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:04,060
Because

906
00:32:04,210 --> 00:32:04,710
the bullies think

907
00:32:04,730 --> 00:32:05,790
they can get away with it.

908
00:32:06,370 --> 00:32:07,580
If you keep swallowing your pride,

909
00:32:07,690 --> 00:32:09,100
all you'll get is more humiliation.

910
00:32:09,210 --> 00:32:10,390
I've been down that road before.

911
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:11,710
But the school is

912
00:32:11,810 --> 00:32:12,710
strictly enforcing discipline.

913
00:32:12,810 --> 00:32:14,790
If this blows up, we're screwed.

914
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:17,910
Things have a way
of working themselves out.

915
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:18,750
We'll be fine.

916
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:20,060
Also,

917
00:32:20,290 --> 00:32:21,350
I've got real stuff to deal with.

918
00:32:21,730 --> 00:32:22,390
Don't have time

919
00:32:22,410 --> 00:32:23,670
for their petty drama.

920
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:24,830
What real stuff?

921
00:32:29,290 --> 00:32:29,870
Lin.

922
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:31,460
Where do we meet tonight?

923
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:32,670
Mr. "Life Is Precious"?

924
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:34,270
Let me see!

925
00:32:34,370 --> 00:32:34,980
Hey, wait, no...

926
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:35,620
What's going on?

927
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:36,270
This is serious.

928
00:32:37,290 --> 00:32:37,750
Yi Tianyu!

929
00:32:37,770 --> 00:32:38,190
Hey!

930
00:32:38,210 --> 00:32:38,910
That's Xuejiao's phone!

931
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:39,940
No phones allowed during morning study.

932
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:41,830
Give me that phone!

933
00:32:43,210 --> 00:32:43,710
Give it back.

934
00:32:43,850 --> 00:32:44,190
No.

935
00:32:45,370 --> 00:32:45,940
What are you doing?

936
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,100
The teacher's here, sit down.

937
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:56,100
Gu Xuejiao.

938
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:58,060
Come with me.

939
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:05,490
He's not extremely

940
00:33:05,510 --> 00:33:06,620
mad at me, right?

941
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:07,370
No way.

942
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:08,490
He's been

943
00:33:08,550 --> 00:33:09,860
drinking ginseng tea every day.

944
00:33:09,990 --> 00:33:10,340
You're fine.

945
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:12,660
Just tell the truth.

946
00:33:14,710 --> 00:33:15,290
Well,

947
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:17,380
just state the facts, okay?

948
00:33:19,630 --> 00:33:20,610
Ms. Yin, leave us.

949
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:23,500
Okay.

950
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:24,540
Be good.

951
00:33:26,710 --> 00:33:27,130
Mr. Fu.

952
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:27,980
Here.

953
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:29,090
Take a look at this video.

954
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:33,900
Mr. Fu,

955
00:33:34,270 --> 00:33:35,250
I've already seen it.

956
00:33:36,630 --> 00:33:37,060
Seen it,

957
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:38,340
and still think you did nothing wrong?

958
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:39,290
She...

959
00:33:41,110 --> 00:33:41,540
Auntie,

960
00:33:41,710 --> 00:33:42,130
this way.

961
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:47,340
Come in.

962
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:51,730
Hello, Mrs. Chen.

963
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,220
Mr. Fu.

964
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:54,260
My child

965
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:55,580
has been bullied at school.

966
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:56,850
I want answers.

967
00:33:58,430 --> 00:33:59,140
Mom.

968
00:34:00,430 --> 00:34:00,930
Mom.

969
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:07,810
Crying doesn't mean she's innocent.

970
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:09,620
This kid

971
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:10,780
is way out of line!

972
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:12,180
No sign of regret at all.

973
00:34:12,910 --> 00:34:16,930
Why regret? I did nothing wrong.

974
00:34:17,470 --> 00:34:18,780
Look at the bruises you left me.

975
00:34:18,830 --> 00:34:19,890
And you say you're innocent?

976
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:21,330
Contour powder?

977
00:34:21,830 --> 00:34:23,410
Even the same shade as mine.

978
00:34:25,430 --> 00:34:26,100
Your arm's dirty.

979
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:26,580
Let me wipe it for you.

980
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:29,330
What are you doing? That hurts!

981
00:34:29,990 --> 00:34:30,740
Why does it hurt?

982
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:32,100
See? Not dirty anymore.

983
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:36,660
My arm's dirty now.

984
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:42,060
Anyway, the evidence is here.

985
00:34:42,430 --> 00:34:43,220
You can't deny it.

986
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:44,740
The school must

987
00:34:44,950 --> 00:34:46,370
handle this issue seriously.

988
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:48,060
Or

989
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:49,970
I'll take this to the education bureau!

990
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:53,410
The bureau's not just
somebody's backyard.

991
00:34:54,470 --> 00:34:55,810
But don't worry, Mrs. Chen.

992
00:34:56,030 --> 00:34:57,010
We'll look into this

993
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:58,370
and get to the bottom of it.

994
00:34:58,910 --> 00:34:59,450
Chen Xiao.

995
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:00,970
Don't exaggerate it.

996
00:35:01,510 --> 00:35:03,260
Tell me what really happened.

997
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:31,410
Gu Xuejiao, what's wrong with you?

998
00:35:31,830 --> 00:35:32,660
You okay, Shiyun?

999
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:34,220
What's it got to do with Xuejiao?

1000
00:35:34,430 --> 00:35:34,970
What's going on here?

1001
00:35:34,990 --> 00:35:35,620
Don't fall for their tricks.

1002
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:36,300
Does it hurt?

1003
00:35:37,390 --> 00:35:37,810
Class 8,

1004
00:35:37,830 --> 00:35:38,330
how could you

1005
00:35:38,350 --> 00:35:39,260
bully your schoolmates?

1006
00:35:40,430 --> 00:35:41,140
What did you say?

1007
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:42,450
Who's bullying them? Watch your mouth!

1008
00:35:42,510 --> 00:35:43,620
Go play somewhere else, losers.

1009
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:44,180
Yi Tianyu!

1010
00:35:44,510 --> 00:35:44,930
People!

1011
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:45,620
Yi Tianyu!

1012
00:35:45,990 --> 00:35:47,100
Don't mess with me!

1013
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:51,410
Can you stop?

1014
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:53,740
Watch it!

1015
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:56,450
Guys, seriously,

1016
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:57,620
can you please stop?

1017
00:35:59,240 --> 00:35:59,740
Guys.

1018
00:35:59,910 --> 00:36:00,450
Wait, guys,

1019
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:01,890
stop it already.

1020
00:36:08,910 --> 00:36:09,450
Don't go too far.

1021
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:10,100
Don't go too far.

1022
00:36:12,510 --> 00:36:13,060
Don't go too far.

1023
00:36:13,910 --> 00:36:14,260
Wait...

1024
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:15,530
Stop.

1025
00:36:16,430 --> 00:36:16,850
No...

1026
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:34,490
How did you...?

1027
00:36:34,950 --> 00:36:35,260
Come on,

1028
00:36:35,470 --> 00:36:35,970
get up.

1029
00:36:39,550 --> 00:36:40,220
Who did this?

1030
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:41,100
Mr. Fu.

1031
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:42,780
Xuejiao didn't mean it.

1032
00:36:42,830 --> 00:36:43,660
Don't blame her.

1033
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:47,580
Stop!

1034
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:48,620
Stop.

1035
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:49,490
Stop fighting.

1036
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:50,370
Guys, guys.

1037
00:36:52,550 --> 00:36:53,810
Gu Xuejiao!

1038
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:54,780
What?

1039
00:36:58,430 --> 00:36:58,850
Why...

1040
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:03,850
Why is it you again?

1041
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:08,300
No, I didn't hit her.

1042
00:37:08,390 --> 00:37:08,780
Mr. Fu.

1043
00:37:08,950 --> 00:37:09,890
I can explain.

1044
00:37:12,870 --> 00:37:13,490
Mr. Fu.

1045
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:14,890
I can vouch for her.

1046
00:37:21,510 --> 00:37:22,100
What you looking at?

1047
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:23,140
It's none of your business!

1048
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:26,940
[ACADEMIC AFFAIRS OFFICE]

1049
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:27,450
It's okay.

1050
00:37:27,510 --> 00:37:27,970
Attention!

1051
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:31,890
When are your parents getting here?

1052
00:37:32,950 --> 00:37:33,370
Mr. Fu.

1053
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:35,300
My dad comes here more often

1054
00:37:35,470 --> 00:37:36,450
than he goes to work.

1055
00:37:37,390 --> 00:37:37,890
He's

1056
00:37:37,990 --> 00:37:39,260
numb to it all.

1057
00:37:39,470 --> 00:37:40,450
Just wait a bit longer.

1058
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:41,740
Mr. Fu.

1059
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:43,580
My parents are really busy.

1060
00:37:43,910 --> 00:37:44,620
I can handle

1061
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:45,970
this small matter on my own.

1062
00:37:46,550 --> 00:37:47,850
What kind of attitude is that?

1063
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:49,220
Starting fights is a small matter?

1064
00:37:49,390 --> 00:37:50,620
Only murder counts as a big deal, huh?

1065
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:52,330
Mr. Fu.

1066
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:54,180
I came here twice today now.

1067
00:37:54,350 --> 00:37:55,700
And it's always her!

1068
00:37:55,950 --> 00:37:57,260
The school has to take action.

1069
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:58,140
Yes, yes.

1070
00:37:58,200 --> 00:37:58,740
Auntie,

1071
00:37:58,990 --> 00:38:00,180
don't blame Xuejiao.

1072
00:38:00,470 --> 00:38:01,740
She's my best friend.

1073
00:38:01,910 --> 00:38:03,140
She'd never hit me on purpose.

1074
00:38:03,350 --> 00:38:04,300
This must be a misunderstanding.

1075
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:05,930
You have

1076
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:07,010
a good heart.

1077
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:07,850
Still defending her

1078
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:08,850
after what she did.

1079
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:10,850
Sorry, sorry.

1080
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:12,260
Went to the bank.

1081
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:13,220
It was crowded.

1082
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:14,140
Thank you for waiting.

1083
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:15,330
Mr. Fu.

1084
00:38:15,990 --> 00:38:17,060
You're personally

1085
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:17,930
handling this matter, huh?

1086
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:19,780
Dafa,

1087
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:21,450
you come to the school

1088
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:23,140
more than our PE teachers.

1089
00:38:23,470 --> 00:38:24,410
I've been meaning to visit you.

1090
00:38:24,470 --> 00:38:25,220
I'll buy you dinner sometime.

1091
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:29,300
Gu, you're here too?

1092
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:32,010
You rascal.

1093
00:38:32,390 --> 00:38:33,580
Saving damsels here, huh?

1094
00:38:34,830 --> 00:38:35,580
Dad.

1095
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:37,330
What are you talking about?

1096
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:39,330
She saved me.

1097
00:38:41,870 --> 00:38:43,700
So she does treat me differently.

1098
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:47,450
Sir.

1099
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:48,850
Do you see your boy's attitude?

1100
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:50,410
Calm down, here,

1101
00:38:50,470 --> 00:38:51,060
cigarette?

1102
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:51,530
Save it!

1103
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:53,850
I quitted.

1104
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:57,850
It's all fate

1105
00:38:58,030 --> 00:38:59,410
that we parents get to know each other

1106
00:38:59,550 --> 00:39:00,580
through our kids.

1107
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:01,010
Here.

1108
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:02,330
Take this.

1109
00:39:02,990 --> 00:39:04,410
My number's on it.

1110
00:39:04,830 --> 00:39:05,300
Alright?

1111
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:06,370
I think

1112
00:39:06,550 --> 00:39:07,300
there's nothing

1113
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:09,300
money can't fix.

1114
00:39:09,470 --> 00:39:10,220
You can't do this

1115
00:39:10,430 --> 00:39:11,410
at our school.

1116
00:39:12,390 --> 00:39:13,780
Then what can we do?

1117
00:39:13,990 --> 00:39:15,300
We'll go with your way.

1118
00:39:15,990 --> 00:39:17,220
Whatever Gu owes,

1119
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:18,180
I'll cover it too.

1120
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:19,660
Dad.

1121
00:39:24,870 --> 00:39:25,370
Uncle,

1122
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:27,140
you don't need to defend me.

1123
00:39:27,390 --> 00:39:27,810
Mr. Fu,

1124
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:29,140
I really didn't hit her.

1125
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:30,850
Students

1126
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:31,930
from the troublemaker class

1127
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:33,260
just can't say a single honest word.

1128
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:34,410
Sir,

1129
00:39:34,550 --> 00:39:36,100
mind your words, please.

1130
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:37,140
Kids

1131
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:38,810
at the age are fragile.

1132
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:40,060
Do you have to say that?

1133
00:39:40,430 --> 00:39:41,010
Are you okay?

1134
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:41,580
Yeah...

1135
00:39:41,950 --> 00:39:42,300
No.

1136
00:39:42,430 --> 00:39:42,890
See?

1137
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:45,700
Mr. Fu.

1138
00:39:45,910 --> 00:39:46,700
I can prove that

1139
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:47,660
I'm telling the truth.

1140
00:39:48,390 --> 00:39:49,260
Go ahead.

1141
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:51,450
Just now we all saw

1142
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:52,850
Zhou Shiyun

1143
00:39:52,990 --> 00:39:54,330
fell toward Mr. Fu.

1144
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:56,180
If I had thrown the ball

1145
00:39:56,510 --> 00:39:57,260
from where I stood,

1146
00:39:57,910 --> 00:39:58,780
and it hit Zhou Shiyun

1147
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:00,260
along a parabolic path.

1148
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:01,370
We all know that

1149
00:40:01,830 --> 00:40:02,700
force pushes

1150
00:40:02,830 --> 00:40:03,740
opposite the impact.

1151
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:05,620
If I really threw it,

1152
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:07,330
