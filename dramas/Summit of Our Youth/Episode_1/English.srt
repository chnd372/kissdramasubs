951
00:36:02,710 --> 00:36:03,610
This is the safest speed.

952

So, our goals are actually

957
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:11,530
the same.

958
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:13,010

959
00:36:13,190 --> 00:36:13,760
going from flunking

00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:14,650

964
00:36:22,420 --> 00:36:23,210
Wrong.

Nonsense.

00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:34,840
There's no legend.

What happened to your safe speed?

976
00:37:00,590 --> 00:37:01,490
Being bugged by a kid

977
00:37:01,590 --> 00:37:02,570
is mentally exhausting,

978
00:37:02,630 --> 00:37:03,400
much less safe.

979

If it weren't for the CU,

980
00:37:18,230 --> 00:37:19,360

982
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:27,090
I had a very good seat.

983
00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:29,280

00:37:29,670 --> 00:37:30,960

there's a bookstore up ahead.

1011
00:38:24,380 --> 00:38:25,170
I went to buy some books.

The owner probably gave it to me

1018
