how come you just brought yourself
to me?

576
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:01,010
Well,

577
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:01,920
we won't disturb

578
00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:02,640
your team bonding.

579
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:03,330
We're leaving.

580
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:05,530
Weren't you pretty tough just now?

581
00:22:06,270 --> 00:22:07,600
Why so scared now?

582
00:22:09,230 --> 00:22:10,210
It's not polite to point

583
00:22:10,550 --> 00:22:11,570
at people like this,

584
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:12,290

585
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:19,680
What can you do about it?

586
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:26,970
I'll count to three.

591
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:47,120
So pathetic.

592
00:22:47,550 --> 00:22:49,490
So these are your friends?

593
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:55,490

594
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:04,120
You alright?

595
00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:04,970
I'm fine.

596
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:10,250
Where's Xuejiao?

597
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:11,120
No idea.

598
00:23:13,550 --> 00:23:14,640
Gu Xuejiao, put it down!

599

You're the ones

603
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:19,570
who cornered me here.

604
00:23:20,070 --> 00:23:20,440
Back!

605
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:23,640

607
00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:25,360
I dare you!

00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:26,440
My hands are shaky.

Xuejiao,

615
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:07,920
let her pick it up herself.

616
00:24:08,310 --> 00:24:10,600
Or you'll make her bag smell bad too.

617
00:24:20,270 --> 00:24:20,880
Thanks.

618
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:30,400
No need to thank me.

00:24:33,350 --> 00:24:33,920
can you

621
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:34,770
give me this

622
00:24:34,830 --> 00:24:35,920

I've got all the materials

629
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:48,970
you said.

630
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:13,920
A quick test,

631
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:15,250
gotta see where you're at now.

632
00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:07,970
Let me see.

633
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:12,730

That's it for today.

637
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:29,970
Finish the food and go home.

638
00:27:32,030 --> 00:27:33,330
With this little?

639
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:35,330
I'm still gonna be hungry.

640
00:27:35,550 --> 00:27:36,680
Then eat more at home.

641
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:39,080
I haven't finished the test yet.

642
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:41,840
You won't be able to.

643
00:27:42,790 --> 00:27:43,680
You've hit your limit.

644
00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:45,770
I was top 20

646
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:48,440
But now you're near the bottom.

647

Face it.

648
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:54,250
I think there's

Well,

651
00:27:58,140 --> 00:27:59,290
I don't think so.

652
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:10,880
Knew you'd give up when it's hard.

653
00:28:59,550 --> 00:29:00,640
We're closing.

654
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:01,680

00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:04,290

657
00:29:15,070 --> 00:29:16,250
Your approach was right this time,

658
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:18,490
but the calculations were
a bit complicated.

659
00:29:19,230 --> 00:29:20,120
Try to simplify it.

660
00:29:20,990 --> 00:29:21,770
Told you.

661
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:22,840
With my brilliant mind,

662
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:24,570
I can definitely solve it.

663
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:27,360
It's late. Finish it when you get home.

664
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:28,730
Then send me a pic of it.

665

I'll make sure

689
00:31:22,830 --> 00:31:23,570

00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:39,770
was it worth it?

696
00:31:39,830 --> 00:31:40,210
Totally.

quit easily.
