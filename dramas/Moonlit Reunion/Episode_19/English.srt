Episode 19

2
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,880
Young Master Mei,
I thought you didn't drink.

3
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,320
You seem to be a good drinker.

4
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,400
But it's a waste to drink like this.

5
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,720
You must enjoy this apricot wine slowly.

6
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:53,880
That's how you get to the real taste.

7
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,440
Besides, it has a strong aftertaste.

8
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:00,280
If you drink like this,
it'll be too much for you.

9
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:02,640
Didn't you help your cousin to his room?

10
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:04,360
Why are you worrying about me?

11
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,080
You're really drunk.

12
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,400
What's wrong?

13
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,200
Don't you recognize me?

14
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:48,880
You…

15
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:56,240
are a fruit.

16
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,520
What fruit?

17
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,480
You are a fruit.

18
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:07,120
You fell from my tree.

19
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,200
This is my tree.

20
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:25,560
Let's go.
The fruit will take you to your room.

21
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:31,160
You have to stay away
from Young Master Pei.

22
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,280
He…

23
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,680
isn't good.

24
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:36,520
Okay.

25
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:39,280
- Young Master Mei is the best. Let's go.
- Hmm.

26
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,720
You always try to charm me.

27
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:30,880
Look at you.
You're even framing me when you're drunk.

28
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,840
I really can't handle you anymore.

29
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,640
Let me lean on you for a while.

30
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:58,080
<i>I wonder what you're thinking.</i>

31
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,400
Is anyone there?

32
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,760
Is anyone there?

33
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,880
Is anyone there?

34
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,880
<i>Why did he choose</i>
<i>this moment to come?</i>

35
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,040
Lady Liu.

36
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,000
Lady Liu.

37
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,840
Lady Liu,

38
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:08,680
I've finally found you.

39
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:37,000
Lady Liu, if you're in big trouble,

40
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:38,840
just tell me.

41
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,440
Hurry up and leave.

42
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:48,880
Demon, leave Lady Liu alone!

43
00:08:57,280 --> 00:09:00,480
She seduced me. She wants to harm.
She is a horrible demon.

44
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:04,800
She's a demon!

45
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:11,600
Lady Liu.

46
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,080
Lady Liu.

47
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,440
Lady Liu, are you all right?

48
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,360
Why did you come back?

49
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:39,680
According to <i>Demon Tales,</i>
when the snake demons shed their skin,

50
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:42,360
they need to drink water,
but they don't need to eat.

51
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:46,040
But I remember
he said when the snake demons are weak,

52
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:49,560
they need to eat aloe vera,
poplar and mulberry.

53
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:51,640
So I picked some fresh mulberry leaves.

54
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:55,000
I don't know which mulberry leaves
are the most effective,

55
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,320
so I prepared some.

56
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,920
<i>How did I come back?</i>

57
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:08,040
Jiya, I'll take you to eat

58
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,360
the baked sesame cake
on the west side of the city later.

59
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:26,480
In the past few days,

60
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:30,960
County Princess Qinghe has been
together with Young Master Pei.

61
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:33,840
Everyone has been watching.

62
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:36,440
They've been walking around
the streets and having fun.

63
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:41,360
Everyone in Chang'an is saying that
they are going to get engaged.

64
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,680
Is that true?

65
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:45,840
I…

66
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:46,920
don't know.

67
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,520
Huh?

68
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,640
Zhuyu…

69
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,760
is it really over between you
and County Princess Qinghe?

70
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,520
Where's the thing I asked for?

71
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,200
Oh!

72
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:06,760
I've brought it with me.
This is what you asked for.

73
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:10,920
Minister Liu said it contains
all the records

74
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,480
on dark magic in Case Chamber.

75
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:17,720
Please thank Minister Liu for me.

76
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:18,800
Mm.

77
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:24,840
But Zhuyu, you can't keep guarding
the county princess forever.

78
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:29,160
If you really care about her,
why don't you take the initiative?

79
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:32,040
I'm not afraid that her heart
belongs to someone else.

80
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,600
I'm just afraid…

81
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:36,880
that she'll fall for someone bad.

82
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:08,040
What's wrong with you, Wu Zhen?

83
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,160
When we go out to have fun,

84
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:12,000
there are always people
gossiping about us.

85
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,240
What a killjoy.

86
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:17,160
You're famous in Chang'an.

87
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,880
It's inevitable.

88
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:19,960
Don't be mad.

89
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:21,760
I think I'm just notorious.

90
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:25,600
Buying rouge? I'm not going.

91
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,840
Fine, don't go then.

92
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:34,280
How about going to the countryside
for a trip in a few days?

93
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,480
It will definitely not be
as noisy as the city.

94
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,920
Jiya, how about we go to Lin'an River?

95
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:45,960
Lin'an River?

96
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,240
Mm.

97
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,920
It's the biggest river
outside of Chang'an.

98
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:54,840
There's an island on the other side.

99
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:57,840
I heard it's beautiful in early autumn.

100
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,200
We'll be on the same boat then

101
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:02,360
and go down the river.

102
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:04,000
We'll wander freely.

103
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:06,360
- Is that good?
- Sure.

104
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:09,160
Whatever you say.

105
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:13,960
- Again.
- Good.

106
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:15,600
One more time.

107
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:20,360
Excuse me.

108
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,880
Do you think Boss will come
to the Demon Underworld tonight?

109
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:29,720
- Why not?
- Boss has been very busy lately.

110
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:34,400
She and Young Master Pei
have been going out together every day.

111
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,720
Everyone in Chang'an says she
and Young Master Pei grew up together

112
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,360
and they're a match made in heaven.

113
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:40,840
Young Master Pei was very happy
when he heard that rumor.

114
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,680
Grew up together?

115
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:46,800
The one who has been
with Xiaozhen for 18 years

116
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,760
isn't Pei Jiya.

117
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:53,280
Hmm?

118
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:56,720
Shu

119
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,840
Come back.

120
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:03,720
Come back to me.

121
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:09,720
Let's work together
to achieve great things.

122
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:13,760
- Get lost!
- Shu.

123
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:16,120
Xiaozhen?

124
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,920
Were you talking to me?

125
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:27,920
No. Why would I be mad at you?

126
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:30,280
I just had a bad dream.

127
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:35,800
Shu, if you have any problems,
you have to tell us.

128
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:37,520
We'll figure it out together.

129
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:42,080
Don't worry. I am second only to the boss
of this Demon Underworld.

130
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:45,880
Nothing can happen to me. Besides,
I'll tell you if there's anything.

131
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,880
Other people are of no importance.

132
00:15:58,680 --> 00:15:59,760
Here you go.

133
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,440
Everything about Xuan Hui's past
is in here.

134
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,440
Just say it.

135
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:18,960
There's something I need your help with.

136
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,800
Well, Lady Liu,

137
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:57,320
what else do you need me to get for you

138
00:16:57,400 --> 00:17:00,400
to help you shed your skin earlier?
So that you suffer less.

139
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:13,600
All right. I'll go and find some more.
Wait for me.

140
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,560
<i>What a fool.</i>

141
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:22,320
Did you see that?

142
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,600
No, that's a snake demon.

143
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:28,760
Look carefully.
Raise your head.

144
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:31,560
A snake demon?

145
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:33,480
- Do you see it?
- What did you catch?

146
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:36,600
It's rare
for a snake demon to appear.

147
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:40,320
We caught this snake demon
from the mountain.

148
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:44,440
She's highly skilled.
She's already in human form.

149
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:50,000
Look, she has scales on her face.

150
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:52,040
As soon as she saw us,

151
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:54,440
she used all sorts
of seductive techniques.

152
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:57,800
- She must be a demon.
- She tried to seduce us with her beauty.

153
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:59,040
You're such a wench!

154
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:02,280
Fortunately, we were unmoved
and caught her together.

155
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:04,080
Behave yourself.

156
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:09,920
This snake demon
is very powerful and cunning.

157
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,680
She tried to escape many times.

158
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,400
I had no choice but to pull out
her snake tendons

159
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:15,560
and chain her up

160
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:18,000
to prevent her from escaping
and harming others.

161
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,320
Do you still dare to run away?
Do you still dare to harm others?

162
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,960
- Behave yourself!
- Stop it!

163
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,680
What are you doing?

164
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:30,200
Does every monster harm humans?

165
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:32,760
Even if she's a demon,
you shouldn't treat her this way.

166
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:38,280
Demons do harm humans.

167
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:40,880
There's no demon in this world
that doesn't harm humans.

168
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:43,080
Listen to me, everyone. Listen to me.

169
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,720
Listen to me, everyone!

170
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,680
Like humans, there is good
and evil among demons.

171
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:50,880
You have not yet
discerned right from wrong,

172
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,200
yet you have treated her so cruelly.

173
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:53,440
Isn't this against humanity?

174
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,440
Why are you being so kind?

175
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,440
How do you know that this demon
doesn't harm humans?

176
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:00,280
Let me tell you. When I caught this demon,
she was eating a child's heart.

177
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:02,080
What are you messing around for? Get lost!

178
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,280
Hey!

179
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:05,200
If she ate you, you wouldn't
be here making all that noise.

180
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,480
He has lost his mind.

181
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:09,320
- That's right.
- Where did he come from?

182
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:11,720
Seriously.

183
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:14,560
- Do you know how hard it was to catch her?
- Yes.

184
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:22,680
<i>That fool</i>
<i>has been out for so long.</i>

185
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:25,120
<i>Did something happen to him?</i>

186
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:45,280
The appearance of a snake demon
is a rare occurrence

187
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:53,520
Are you all right?

188
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,920
Don't be afraid.

189
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,640
I'm the one just now…

190
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,840
I remember you.

191
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:11,600
You can talk?

192
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:14,680
Mm-hmm.

193
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:19,720
You…

194
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,640
Did you really eat a child's heart?

195
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,720
No, that's nonsense.

196
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:30,480
I knew it. Demons aren't born evil.

197
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:33,160
Besides, those two
are just ordinary hunters.

198
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:36,160
If you had eaten a child's heart,

199
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:38,440
you wouldn't have been
trapped here so easily.

200
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:43,000
You're a newly-formed demon, right?

201
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:50,440
You don't mind that I'm a demon?

202
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:52,240
So what if you're a demon?

203
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:56,000
If you're not wrong, you shouldn't be
trapped here and let them torture you.

204
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:58,080
Even if you're wrong,

205
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:00,880
it's your victims
who should seek justice from you.

206
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:04,200
Why are you locked up here,
performing to make money for them?

207
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:07,760
I'll think of a way
to get you out of here.

208
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,320
You want to take me away?

209
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,520
Don't be afraid.

210
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:15,160
I'll get you out of here
and you'll be free.

211
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:16,400
I'm not using you.

212
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:19,880
You…

213
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:22,280
Don't eat this.

214
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,680
- Eat this. This is good.
- This…

215
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:28,080
What…

216
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:31,760
- …is this?
- Mulberry leaves.

217
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:34,960
It's the season for snakes
to shed their skins.

218
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:37,880
And you're so weak. This is good for you.

219
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:40,960
Huh?

220
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,000
You're not a snake.

221
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:58,880
I…

222
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:03,640
This rich kid is quite smart.

223
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:05,520
He figured it out himself.

224
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:08,400
So what if he figured it out?

225
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,960
Weren't those rich fools who had no brains

226
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:15,320
all fooled by this young lady's beauty?

227
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:20,160
No matter what, the important thing is
that we can make a big deal again.

228
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:25,880
Fortunately, this time
we chose this snake girl

229
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:27,600
who is so beautiful

230
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:30,360
that she can help us
catch so many big fish.

231
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,880
As long as we succeed this time,

232
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:36,760
we'll be able to enjoy ourselves
for a while.

233
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:55,880
Actually, there has never been
any snake demon.

234
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:58,120
I was accidentally kidnapped by them.

235
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:01,440
They always beat me up

236
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:02,880
and even forced me

237
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,440
to disguise myself like this.

238
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:08,480
It's all just a gimmick to do a show.

239
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:13,040
How can there be such
abominable men in this world?

240
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:15,080
How despicable. I'll save you.

241
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:16,720
Wait, Young Master.

242
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:19,160
He untied it. Hurry up.

243
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:25,640
Hurry up. Come on.

244
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:28,440
You're really back. What?

245
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:32,320
You want to take advantage of our absence
to release this demon?

246
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,920
Miss, run now!
I'll hold him back.

247
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:37,920
Don't move!

248
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,960
- Let go!
- Don't move!

249
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:42,280
Let go of me!

250
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:45,080
Did you tell her to run? Where to?

251
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:47,080
We're all in this together.

252
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:50,240
Ever since she joined us,
she has duped many fools

253
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:53,240
like you who are attracted to beauty.

254
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:56,800
She pretends to be a snake demon
to lure young men,

255
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,600
then reveals its true form
and pretends to be pitiful.

256
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:02,440
That's just an old trick.

257
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,400
But you're different from them
in one way or another.

258
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,680
Other people would have
chickened out by now.

259
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:13,520
But you tried to hold us back
and stall for time so she could escape.

260
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:17,720
You're the most
foolish person we've ever met.

261
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,920
- What a big fool.
- Don't waste your breath on him.

262
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,840
Tie him up. We'll take him
to his manor and ask for money.

263
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:27,720
Don't move.

264
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:32,640
- Stay still.
- Let go of me.

265
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:36,960
Let's go.

266
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,000
All right.

267
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,760
I don't think they'll come after us.

268
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:13,720
Young Master,

269
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:16,400
I…

270
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:20,480
I did lie to you today.

271
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:22,280
But I didn't mean to.

272
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:26,040
I was under their control.
If I hadn't helped them commit fraud…

273
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:29,600
they would have beaten
and scolded me all the time.

274
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:31,720
I was just trying to survive.

275
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:34,640
I see.

276
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:39,080
Now that you are safe,
don't ever lie again.

277
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:41,080
I'll take my leave.

278
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:44,240
Young Master.

279
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:48,160
What is it?

280
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:54,040
I'm lucky to be saved by you today.

281
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:56,640
I don't have anything with me

282
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,600
and I can't repay you.

283
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:02,240
If you don't mind,

284
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:05,520
I'm willing to serve you
for the rest of my life.

285
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:09,080
Miss, I saved you
without expecting anything in return.

286
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:10,880
I did it willingly.

287
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:13,920
Miss, I don't deserve that.

288
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:16,680
Is it because of what happened earlier
that you don't want to believe me?

289
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:18,720
Get up.

290
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:24,240
I know you're a pitiable person.

291
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,320
In the courtyard just now,

292
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,720
thanks to you for switching sides
and helping me.

293
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:30,080
But as they said,

294
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:32,760
there was more than one person
who got in trouble for saving you.

295
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:35,960
Only you know whether you feel guilty

296
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:37,560
about all this.

297
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:40,640
I only know

298
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:43,400
that when people do evil,
it is more terrifying than demons.

299
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:47,640
Miss, my betrothed
is still waiting for me at home.

300
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:48,880
Goodbye.

301
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:10,040
Lady Liu.

302
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:13,800
Are you well? So you're feeling better?

303
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:15,680
You're quite bold.

304
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:20,200
I thought you would flee in panic
when you saw my demon form.

305
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:21,880
Flee?

306
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:25,520
Of course not.
It's just a bit of a surprise.

307
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:27,720
You should have told me earlier.

308
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:29,640
Why would I tell you earlier?

309
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:31,400
We're engaged.

310
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:33,800
A husband and wife
should be honest with each other.

311
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:35,600
I'm a demon.

312
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:38,480
Yes, I saw it.

313
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,920
And you still say we're engaged?

314
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:46,720
You're a demon, and our marriage
was decided by our families.

315
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:49,040
What do these two things
have to do with each other?

316
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:53,840
You want to marry a demon?

317
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:57,880
No.
I didn't think about it before.

318
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:00,480
I want to marry you.

319
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,480
But you are a demon.

320
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:07,520
Come to think of it,
no other man's wife can compare to you.

321
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:10,000
They don't have
such beautiful snake forms.

322
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:17,760
Beautiful?

323
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:22,280
More beautiful than those in <i>Demon Tales.</i>

324
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:24,480
You're the most beautiful
I have ever seen.

325
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:30,640
You're talking as if
you've seen other snake demons.

326
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:33,760
I wanted to give you a surprise.

327
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:35,640
But Little Loach is so ugly.

328
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:37,320
I'm sure you don't like it.

329
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:38,400
What?

330
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:41,640
I mean, in<i> Demon Tales,</i>

331
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:45,400
there's no mention
of a demon being so beautiful.

332
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:57,160
Do you still think I'm beautiful?

333
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:03,720
My identity as a snake demon
must remain a secret.

334
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:05,720
If you dare to tell anyone,

335
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:08,480
I'll swallow you whole
like I did just now.

336
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:12,400
So watch your mouth.

337
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:18,600
Lady Liu, where are you going?

338
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:20,440
Return to Chang'an.

339
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:22,200
All right, I'll go with you.

340
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:30,680
Duke Wu manor

341
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:41,680
Lady Mingzhuang.

342
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:49,840
What are you doing?

343
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:52,720
We are delivering
my young master's betrothal gift.

344
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:56,480
Betrothal gift? Did Lady Wu agree?

345
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:59,000
It goes without saying
that this is the case.

346
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:02,200
Today, my young master has arranged
to go on a trip with the county princess.

347
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:06,440
When they're alone together,
it's proposal time.

348
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,280
Alone together?

349
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:14,280
- Where did they go?
- Outside Chang'an City.

350
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:15,600
Lin'an River.

351
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:29,040
- Xiao Fu, Xiao Zhen.
- Hmm?

352
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:31,640
Why did you deliberately tell
Young Master Mei about this?

353
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:34,000
Lady Mingzhuang, what do you mean?

354
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:37,200
It was Young Master Mei who asked,
and we answered.

355
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:50,800
Lady Wu.

356
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,360
Lady Wu.

357
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:00,440
<i>That's not right.</i>
<i>The scent is off.</i>

358
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:14,320
Commander Mei. My young master
is currently sightseeing in Lin'an

359
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:16,840
with County Princess Qinghe.
Nobody else shall disturb them.

360
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:18,960
I'm sorry, but I have to disturb them.

361
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:22,480
Commander Mei!

362
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:56,360
What are you reading?

363
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:59,120
There's a rumor going around in Chang'an.

364
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:01,240
They say Chang'an is infested with evil.

365
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:03,520
Jiya, have you heard?

366
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:07,960
It's just nonsense from ignorant people.

367
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:11,400
There is no such thing as evil spirits
in this world.

368
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:14,400
Wu Zhen, don't think too much.

369
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:17,800
But they made it sound so convincing.

370
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:19,880
I can't help but believe it.

371
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:23,800
This ancient book contains

372
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:25,680
many stories of evil spirits
and strange phenomena.

373
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:28,360
There is a story

374
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:33,240
about someone who made a deal
with a demon using his body and blood

375
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:36,520
in order to obtain the power he desired.

376
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:40,280
Jiya, don't you think it's interesting?

377
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:46,640
It's quite a novel.
I've never heard of it before.

378
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:48,720
What happened next?

379
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:52,000
After that,
this person became a demon himself.

380
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:30,680
If I had known
that you like this kind of book,

381
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:32,400
I would have found it for you.

382
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:39,240
What is this incense carving pattern?

383
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:41,560
Auspicious clouds.

384
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:50,800
Do you still have any doubts?

385
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:54,680
The pattern on this incense
looks like auspicious clouds.

386
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:57,360
But from my angle…

387
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:00,680
it looks like there's an eye hidden in it.

388
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:31,120
Who are you?

389
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:50,480
<i>The scent</i>
<i>suppresses my techniques.</i>

390
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:47,240
There is a rumor about eyes in this book.

391
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:53,360
- Jiya, take a look.
- All right.

392
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:09,240
Wu Zhen, are you teasing me again?

393
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:11,800
There are no words in this book.

394
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:17,320
How is that possible? Look carefully.

395
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:54,400
The origin of this book is unknown,
and it is extremely unlucky.

396
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,240
It's better if you don't read it.

397
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:14,720
Wu Zhen, no!

398
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:23,720
<i>This won't do.</i>

399
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:25,480
<i>I have to think of a way</i>
<i>to stop the formation.</i>

400
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:35,760
<i>Wu Zhen, you must not die.</i>

401
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:43,680
What person are you?

402
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:46,760
You're wrong. I'm not a person.

403
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:19,360
You're fine?

404
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:21,720
But you're not fine at all.

405
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:36,360
Run.

406
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:25,120
Let's go.

407
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:41,280
It is indeed Oppression Spell.

408
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:42,360
Yes.

409
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:45,480
Mei is up to no good.

410
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:47,200
He has been harassing
Wu Zhen day and night.

411
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:50,160
I just want to teach him a lesson.
What's wrong?

412
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:54,240
Don't come near me.

413
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:56,520
My benefactor
is a master beyond the world.

414
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:59,000
If you lay a finger on me,
he won't let you go!

415
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:10,800
Open the formation.

416
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:20,800
I'll give you another chance.

417
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:22,440
Open the formation now.

418
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:25,400
This formation cannot be opened.

419
