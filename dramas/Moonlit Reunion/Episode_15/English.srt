00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,760
Episode 15

2
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:00,080
<i>When I took you with me,</i>

3
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:01,920
<i>I left a Dark Talisman on the door.</i>

4
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,400
A tracking talisman?

5
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,640
I can tell from the spell they used.

6
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:21,200
If they used evil magic,
it would appear black.

7
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:24,120
If they used Taoist magic,
it would emit a white light.

8
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:28,000
If they were ordinary people,
it would not glow.

9
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:31,560
What if it's vermilion?

10
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,400
Dark cultivation.

11
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:35,760
Dark cultivation?

12
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,320
Master said so.

13
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41,280
Why don't I remember that?

14
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:52,120
Dark cultivation
is evil magic from the Western Regions.

15
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:55,120
It uses flesh and blood as guides
to activate spells.

16
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,560
Although the magical power is limited,

17
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,040
the method of cultivation
is extremely cruel.

18
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:06,600
I think you were poisoned on purpose.

19
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,520
But…

20
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,120
when did I get poisoned?

21
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,720
We eat and live together.

22
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,640
Why was I the only one who got poisoned?

23
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,080
During the banquet just now,
I didn't drink the wine.

24
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,240
I didn't touch the food either.

25
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:31,520
You mean…

26
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,920
Pei Jiya?

27
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,840
But why did he repay
kindness with ingratitude?

28
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,600
If he did it on purpose,

29
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:42,840
then the so-called kindness
might have been part of his plan.

30
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:47,440
Besides, he mentioned the realms
of Chang'an just now.

31
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:50,200
Seeing that it's related to evil magic,

32
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,200
we have to be careful.

33
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,240
In that case…

34
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,360
what should we do?

35
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,080
You should leave now.

36
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,560
Go back to Changxi Palace
and explain the situation.

37
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:00,640
I'll go back to Chang'an

38
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,200
- and see what he's all about.
- All right.

39
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:27,840
Wu Zhen!

40
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,200
Wu Zhen!

41
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,320
Are you all right?

42
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:11,440
Jiya.

43
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:14,760
Long time no see, Wu Zhen.

44
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:22,600
Chang'an

45
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,680
Did you hear
about what happened

46
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:26,000
at Ruyi Pavilion last night?

47
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,160
I heard County Princess Qinghe
has a new lover.

48
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,160
Lady Wu hasn't changed at all.

49
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:37,560
I'm the only one…

50
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,200
who can help you?

51
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,560
That's right.

52
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,720
Mei Si, you attend a lot of banquets.

53
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:45,560
Do you know anyone in the city?

54
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,400
I do.

55
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,520
What is it?

56
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:55,760
On my way back to the city,
I noticed someone suspicious.

57
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:59,280
I want to find out something
to ease my mind.

58
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,760
If you're not in a hurry,
give me two days.

59
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:04,200
I'll familiarize myself
with the people here.

60
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:05,400
We can ask them anything then.

61
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:08,000
All right. Thank you, Mei Si.

62
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,040
It's no big deal.

63
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:12,840
By the way,

64
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:14,760
on my way back,

65
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,600
I heard a lot of people
talking about Lady Wu.

66
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:18,760
Is she all right?

67
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:23,240
She's very well.

68
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,520
While you were away from Chang'an
for one day,

69
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,520
Wu Zhen has moved on.

70
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,160
Now, the new blood outshines the old.

71
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,240
You're old news now.

72
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:34,560
Everyone in Chang'an is talking

73
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,080
about how County Princess Qinghe

74
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,920
and a young man were being intimate

75
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,960
in public at Ruyi Pavilion.

76
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:43,880
A young man?

77
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:45,760
Uh…

78
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,680
I'll stop teasing you.

79
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:51,040
This rumor is half true and half false.

80
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,480
Which half is true,
and which half is false?

81
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:58,760
It's true that they were intimate,
but the man is not her new lover.

82
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,120
What do you mean?

83
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,080
Let me put it this way.

84
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:04,400
It's not someone new.

85
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,920
He's Wu Zhen's childhood friend.

86
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,640
He's her uncle's adopted son.

87
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,560
He's the eldest son
of the Pei family in Kunzhou,

88
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,600
Pei Jiya.

89
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,440
I am Pei Jiya from Kunzhou.

90
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:26,560
The tracking talisman

91
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,920
shows the spell that was used.

92
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:31,920
The vermilion color means…

93
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,200
It's dark cultivation.

94
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,560
Duke Wu's manor

95
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:52,440
- Young Master Mei. You're back.
- Where's Lady Wu?

96
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:53,560
She's in the back yard.

97
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:54,800
We have a guest.

98
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,680
It really is you.

99
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:18,680
Why are you here?

100
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:25,280
So Lady Wu
is the one you're looking for in Chang'an.

101
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:28,080
Are you surprised?

102
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:32,800
It seems that you are here for Jiya,
Young Master Mei.

103
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,520
I heard about what happened

104
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,400
- between you two from Jiya.
- What did he say?

105
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,040
I turned our encounter into an anecdote

106
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,360
and told Wu Zhen about it.

107
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:48,040
I didn't think you and Wu Zhen
knew each other.

108
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,160
What a surprise.

109
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,760
What kind of anecdote?

110
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:54,360
Don't you know what you did,
Young Master Mei?

111
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,200
Don't worry.
I only told her the truth.

112
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:59,920
Young Master Mei and I met by chance.

113
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,080
Later, we encountered bandits.

114
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:06,080
My maids,
Xiao Fu and Xiao Zhen were so scared.

115
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,040
Young Master Mei, you were the hero
who saved the damsels in distress.

116
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:11,680
Later, we ate together
and had a long talk.

117
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:15,680
My maids still idolize you,
Young Master Mei.

118
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,680
By the way, Wu Zhen,

119
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:20,800
Young Master Mei even wishes for us
to always be there for each other.

120
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,240
Oh my, isn't he generous?

121
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,440
He has always been generous.

122
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,400
Young Master Mei, what brings you here?

123
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:38,360
What brings Young Master Pei here?

124
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,800
It's rare for you
to be interested in others.

125
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,560
The Pei family started

126
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:49,280
with the spice business.

127
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,760
Jiya came all the way here

128
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,480
for the Scented Duel.

129
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:54,800
He will be staying at the Duke manor
in the meantime.

130
00:12:58,920 --> 00:12:59,960
Please don't mind me.

131
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:03,120
<i>I make fragrances for a hobby.</i>

132
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,120
<i>I'm quite sensitive to scents.</i>

133
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,280
Lady Wu.

134
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
You took my carriage yesterday.

135
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,920
I had to walk all the way back.

136
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,320
My leg injury must have relapsed.

137
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:21,360
I can only disturb you
for a few more days.

138
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:26,120
I'm afraid that's against the rules.

139
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,160
How can an outsider

140
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,360
live here?

141
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:33,320
If you can live here,
I can live here too.

142
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,720
You and I are different.

143
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:38,120
Wu Zhen and I grew up together.

144
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,520
I lived here when I was young.

145
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:43,960
Lady Wu and I are sworn friends.

146
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:45,960
I also lived here some time ago.

147
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,280
That's enough.

148
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,840
You can both stay here.

149
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:53,400
We can take care…

150
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,440
of 10 people here.

151
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,440
Lady Wu Zhen.

152
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:23,440
Didn't Young Master Mei say
he was moving away?

153
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:24,880
Why did he suddenly come back?

154
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:29,480
Did you know that Young Master Mei
was coming back?

155
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,160
I didn't.

156
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:35,280
It's just that after I heard from Jiya
that they met in the western suburbs,

157
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:39,040
I guessed
that Young Master Mei might come back.

158
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,880
He came back because of Young Master Pei?

159
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:43,000
Young Master Mei sure is strange.

160
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:45,600
He's not strange.

161
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,200
In fact, Jiya is the one…

162
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:49,800
I find strange.

163
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:54,640
I wonder what you think

164
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,560
about those gentlemen, Lady Wu.

165
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,760
You're going to report to sis again.

166
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:02,880
Please answer, Lady Wu.

167
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,000
I am neither biased nor partial.

168
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:10,000
I am merely a silent observer.

169
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:20,920
What do you think of my outfit,
Young Master Mei?

170
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,160
May I ask, Young Master Pei?

171
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,400
Was it a coincidence
that we met at the western suburbs?

172
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,720
There are no coincidences in this world.

173
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:30,920
It's all fate.

174
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:35,400
In that case,
did you go into my room last night?

175
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:42,760
Did you lose something, Young Master Mei?

176
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:46,040
No.

177
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,120
That's good.

178
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:51,520
You don't have to make assumptions
about why I came to Chang'an.

179
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:54,400
Although I supposedly came here
for the Scented Duel,

180
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,680
I don't care about the contest.

181
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:58,840
I only care about Wu Zhen.

182
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:01,560
I can tell.

183
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:07,320
A few days ago,
you said you liked someone.

184
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,640
Is it Wu Zhen?

185
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:10,720
Yes.

186
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:13,120
Since you care so much about her,

187
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:16,120
why did you say it's not meant to be?

188
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:19,120
I have my reasons.

189
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:23,960
It seems that Wu Zhen
is not that important to you.

190
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:27,640
Graceful heart, noble character

191
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:31,480
Young Master Mei, your room is ready.
You can rest now.

192
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:32,800
Hmm.

193
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:44,800
Graceful heart, noble character

194
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,120
Young Master, I told you!

195
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,160
You should've made it more potent.

196
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:51,880
I…

197
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,000
am still too kindhearted.

198
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:05,400
Duke Wu's manor

199
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:14,960
Graceful heart, noble character

200
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:25,240
I remember we used to play this
when we were children.

201
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:27,880
But we didn't have many tricks back then.

202
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:29,800
The arrows weren't
as beautiful as they are now.

203
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:32,560
Life gets better.

204
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:34,920
But I liked it when we were young.

205
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,520
It was just you and me back then.

206
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:45,720
But your pitching skills

207
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:48,320
are not as good as when we were young.

208
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,400
Yes, I haven't played it for years.

209
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:59,080
I heard that you like books
about talented men and beautiful women.

210
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,280
These are the latest trends.

211
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,840
I've collected them for you.

212
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:05,920
I don't like them anymore.

213
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,320
All these books are filled
with romantic stories

214
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,200
about the woman choosing her partner,

215
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:12,240
and his feelings match hers.

216
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:13,320
How boring.

217
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:18,840
Although it's a clichéd story,
it has a happy ending.

218
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:21,960
Happy ending?

219
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:24,480
What's there to be happy about?

220
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:26,760
They end up getting married.

221
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:29,040
The most important thing to a woman

222
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:31,000
is to find the right man.

223
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:32,840
- Why?
- What?

224
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:37,320
I asked why

225
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:39,440
the most important thing for a woman

226
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:40,720
is to find the right man.

227
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,640
A woman is soft.

228
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:45,800
She should have someone
to rely on and a home to return to.

229
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:49,880
She should be protected like a treasure.
She'll live a carefree life.

230
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:51,800
Mm.

231
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,120
You are right.

232
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,480
The most important thing in a woman's life

233
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,640
is to find someone reliable to depend on.

234
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:29,600
Why is a demon picking on him again?

235
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:31,320
That little book demon sure is useless.

236
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:32,400
Right.

237
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,480
Do you have all kinds of books here?

238
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:54,800
What books are you looking for?

239
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:59,240
The old man from the Four Factions told me
to reinforce the Demon Underworld barrier.

240
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:00,920
I'm here to find a way.

241
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:02,880
Demon Underworld's barrier?

242
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:04,600
And you are…

243
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,480
I'm Cat Lord.

244
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:34,400
I have something to ask you.

245
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:37,480
Do you still remember
how to make sugar cakes?

246
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:38,920
Yes.

247
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,400
Snake Lord isn't here yet.

248
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:49,520
It might take a while.

249
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,880
I'm here to send you some food.

250
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:53,720
I didn't order any food.

251
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,520
Someone told me to bring it to you,
Cat Lord.

252
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:14,560
I've told you before
to cut down on the candy.

253
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:17,280
See? You have a toothache now.

254
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,120
Stop criticizing me.

255
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:24,880
I'm doing this for your own good.

256
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:27,720
Don't worry.

257
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:29,800
For the meeting later,
I'll go on your behalf.

258
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,960
I'll say you're in a bad mood
because of a toothache,

259
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:34,200
and you'd end up scolding Elder Hui.

260
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:36,640
Those old men
wouldn't dare do anything to you.

261
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Thank you.

262
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:41,520
I'll clean up after you.

263
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,680
Isn't this candy banned by Wu Zi Shu?

264
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:07,880
They say it's too sweet.

265
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:10,120
It'll damage
the younger demons' teeth easily.

266
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,800
Why is it being sold again?

267
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:12,880
I don't know.

268
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:17,000
I heard that you've been surrounded
by men lately.

269
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:18,120
You're very carefree.

270
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:21,480
It's rare for you to be so well-informed,
Snake Lord.

271
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:23,080
I didn't want to be.

272
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:27,200
It's just that this news
has caused a stir in Chang'an.

273
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:29,160
It's hard for me not to hear it.

274
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:31,320
Did you ask me to come just to school me?

275
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:39,840
Actually, there is something.

276
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:43,480
Are you asking me for a favor?

277
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:47,720
The Scented Duel is coming up soon.

278
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,520
I've been a Scented Judge all these years.

279
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:51,720
But lately,

280
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,400
I've been feeling unwell.

281
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:56,680
You're about to shed.

282
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,320
Mm.

283
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:02,800
I can't stand
you reptilian demons.

284
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,560
You're always shedding your skin.

285
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,960
Tell me. Are you going to help me or not?

286
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,400
Beg me.

287
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:15,640
Please.

288
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:20,720
All right, I'll help you.

289
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:22,960
But…

290
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:24,040
But what?

291
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:28,200
Speaking of being a judge
for the Scented Duel,

292
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:30,120
I don't know anything about fragrances.

293
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:32,280
I doubt I can do it.

294
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:35,040
A lot of experienced Scented Judges
will be present.

295
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:36,880
You just need to go along with them.

296
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,360
Besides, Ling Xiao will be there too.

297
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:39,520
He'll help you.

298
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:51,280
That's all I wanted to talk to you about.

299
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:52,440
I'll be out of your way.

300
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:57,880
Xiao…

301
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:00,120
Cat Lord.

302
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:01,720
It's time to soak in the hot spring.

303
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:08,160
About what happened before,
I was too extreme.

304
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:10,240
Please don't be mad.

305
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:16,240
I've been reciting the Demon Law for days.

306
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:17,960
I can even recite it backwards.

307
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:27,440
I got Xuan Feng

308
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:29,240
to make this sugar cake secretly.

309
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:31,320
It still tastes the same.

310
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:46,080
The demonic power you lost a few days ago

311
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,520
has almost recovered.

312
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:49,440
It's time for you to soak
in the hot spring.

313
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:08,320
Hold!

314
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:27,040
Be careful.

315
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:31,160
What's going on?

316
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:32,720
I'm just popular.

317
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:36,240
Tomorrow morning,

318
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:38,040
I'll bring you to the Scented Duel,
Lady Wu.

319
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:39,280
Mm.

320
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,720
Wu Zhen, what is going on?

321
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:53,800
Tomorrow,

322
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:55,560
I might not be able to join in on the fun.

323
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:58,200
I've been entrusted to be a Scented Judge.

324
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:02,320
Please go easy on me tomorrow.

325
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:15,240
<i>Scented Duel?</i>

326
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:47,840
The Scented Judges here today
are all the current masters of scents.

327
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:49,400
For example, Mr. Xie and Mr. Gao.

328
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:52,760
But my Lord,
remember to stay away from them.

329
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:55,120
Why is that?

330
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,800
You beat up Mr. Xie's second nephew

331
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,880
and Mr. Gao's younger nephew.

332
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:04,040
However, the most powerful one

333
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:08,240
is the main judge, Anbilo.

334
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:15,640
- Master An is here.
- Greetings, sirs.

335
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:17,480
Master An!

336
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,600
That's Anbilo.

337
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:21,200
- Long time no see.
- Currently… No.

338
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:23,760
He's the best master perfumer
in the past century.

339
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,400
Master.

340
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:27,720
Deputy Minister Wang.

341
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:31,080
His judgment
greatly determines today's outcome.

342
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:32,720
You're drooling.

343
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:34,840
He's coming.

344
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:39,720
May I ask who you are?

345
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:42,160
Master An.

346
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:43,800
Lady Liu is unwell.

347
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:45,440
Unfortunately, she can't be here today.

348
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:47,920
This is Her Majesty's younger sister

349
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,400
and Duke Wu's second wife,
County Princess Qinghe.

350
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:53,800
Your Highness.

351
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:56,040
Master An, you don't have to be so polite.

352
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:58,400
May I ask if you know fragrances too?

353
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:00,880
Just a little.

354
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:04,840
Master An, we would be making a fool
of ourselves

355
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:06,720
to talk about fragrances in your presence.

356
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:08,840
Everyone would say
that they only know a thing or two.

357
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:10,120
Hmm…

358
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:11,960
Your Highness, am I right?

359
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:14,160
You're too modest, Your Highness.

360
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:19,040
You must be

361
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:21,080
the owner of Yuzhen Pavilion,
Mr. Ling Xiao.

362
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:24,360
You actually know me.

363
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:28,760
The fragrances at Yuzhen Pavilion
is well-known in Chang'an.

364
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:30,280
I've heard of it too.

365
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:32,800
At the Scented Duel today,

366
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:35,640
Your Highness and Mr. Ling Xiao,

367
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:38,000
please enlighten us with your knowledge.

368
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:39,760
How could we? You…

369
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:41,800
You…

370
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:45,640
Master An knows me.
Master An recognizes me!

371
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:47,480
Master An recognizes…

372
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:48,720
Ling Xiao.

373
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:51,360
Do you smell something strange?

374
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:53,960
What smell?

375
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:56,400
I think it's the smell of a lapdog.

376
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:58,600
A lapdog?

377
00:28:58,680 --> 00:28:59,760
Where's the lapdog?

378
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:02,400
What a strong smell.

379
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:03,680
Where's the lapdog?

380
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:06,600
Lapdog? Are you calling me a lapdog?

381
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:09,240
I'll be one, just because he's Master An!

382
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:10,720
Hmph.

383
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:13,960
The fragrances presented
at the Scented Duel

384
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:17,000
are divided into four tiers<i>…</i>
Ordinary, Premium,

385
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:20,480
Exquisite, and Rare.

386
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:22,640
Depending on the tier,

387
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:26,800
the highest-ranked fragrances

388
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:29,000
will advance to the final round.

389
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:33,160
It's up to the audience and Scented Judges

390
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:36,320
to choose the final winner.

391
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:38,600
And this year's prize

392
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:42,240
is the rare Unicorn Horn Resin.

393
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:46,520
Wu Zhen.

394
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:48,520
Why are you here?

395
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:50,560
Where's Lady Liu?

396
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:57,840
Young Master Mei, it seems like
you like to join in the fun.

397
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:02,320
I'm was worried about you coming here.

398
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:03,880
So I asked Mei Si to bring me here.

399
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:16,920
Master Anbilo will be the Scented Judge.

400
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:19,640
Please welcome Master An!

401
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:00,560
Chang'an Scented Duel

402
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:01,840
begins now!

403
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:14,960
I'm the perfumer
at Jiuhe Fragrance Shop in Qizhou.

404
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:17,320
I've traveled overseas for years

405
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:19,960
to look for aloeswood from Molo.

406
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:22,640
I've sealed it with storax balsam oil
for 100 days

407
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:25,000
and made it into Leyou Incense.

408
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:26,640
I present it to all of you.

409
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,680
The recipe is simple.

410
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:31,960
What's so special about aloeswood?

411
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:33,520
Mr. Gao is right.

412
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:36,200
I find this incense quite interesting.

413
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:39,400
The wood fragrance seems
to have a jaggery scent.

414
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:43,440
May I ask who you are?

415
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:47,560
I am Pei Jiya from Kunzhou.

416
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:52,080
So it's him.

417
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,160
No wonder.

418
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:56,000
The Pei family's spices are well-known.

419
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,760
I've long heard that you're good

420
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:00,400
at fragrances too, Young Master Pei.

421
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:04,320
No one will have an opinion

422
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:06,200
about you being a Scented Judge.

423
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:13,760
Let's light the incense first.

424
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:15,640
Mm.

425
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:30,760
<i>What else is there</i>
<i>in this fragrant aroma?</i>

426
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:32,360
<i>It's the smell of blood.</i>

427
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:45,280
Exquisite

428
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:47,840
Exquisite

429
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:56,320
Ordinary

430
00:32:57,680 --> 00:33:00,880
I don't smell any fragrance at all.

431
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:05,800
Ordinary

432
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:12,600
Anbilo must've caught typhoid.

433
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:15,520
- His nose is blocked.
- Nonsense.

434
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:17,720
Master An has excellent taste.

435
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:19,360
He's extraordinary.

436
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:30,320
Ordinary

437
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:35,880
Your Highness.

438
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:40,880
May I ask why you only
give it an "Ordinary"?

439
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:45,920
I think in this fragrance,
there's a hint of blood.

440
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:49,280
Blood?

441
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:52,880
Uh, please elaborate, Your Highness.

442
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:06,680
The incense may have a strange scent,

443
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:08,400
but the ingredient
is not easily obtainable.

444
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:10,840
I heard that the slave laborers in Molo

445
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:12,160
are risking their lives

446
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:13,680
to climb up cliffs

447
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,960
just to get the nectar from aloeswood.

448
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:18,480
Who knows how much blood
and sweat they put into it?

449
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:21,160
Her Highness must have thought of this,

450
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:22,360
hence why she feels that the Leyou Incense

451
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:24,240
doesn't live up to its name.

452
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:26,760
Sir.

453
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:28,160
You're knowledgeable.

454
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:06,920
Premium

455
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:09,280
Ordinary

456
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:13,000
Ordinary

457
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:30,120
Ordinary

458
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,320
He's here for the contest, no?

459
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:53,680
Why is he winking at Wu Zhen?

460
00:35:58,120 --> 00:36:00,240
This incense
is called Fragrance of the Past.

461
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:03,200
Fragrance of the Past?

462
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:06,160
What…

463
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:09,160
a random name.

464
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:12,600
I created this incense myself.

465
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:17,360
Forget it.

466
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:20,400
Young Master Pei, please go ahead.

467
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:17,040
Fragrance of the Past.
