00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:31,026
(Moonlit Reunion)

2
00:01:31,107 --> 00:01:33,920
(Episode 18)

3
00:01:35,637 --> 00:01:37,990
Keeper Mei, how did you find out about the suppression technique?

4
00:01:39,519 --> 00:01:41,200
In Arcane Appraisal Bureau's Records Vault,

5
00:01:41,745 --> 00:01:43,192
there are records concerning such sorcery

6
00:01:43,375 --> 00:01:45,138
in the case files from 60 years ago.

7
00:01:46,523 --> 00:01:48,833
You actually remembered it, huh? You have a good memory.

8
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,593
It was bizarre that Fourth Brother was harmed without any reason.

9
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:55,232
Lady Wu Zhen, I wonder if you were doing fine today.

10
00:01:56,239 --> 00:01:57,273
I'm fine.

11
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,113
What about you, Keeper Shi?

12
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:01,237
I'm fine as well.

13
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:07,553
I wonder how long you're planning to stay in Duke Wu's Residence this time.

14
00:02:08,439 --> 00:02:12,833
You once said that you could afford to support ten of me, right?

15
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:15,953
Being able to support you is one thing

16
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:18,712
while wanting to support you is an entirely different thing.

17
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:21,632
After all, before this, you said you wanted to leave.

18
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,152
And now, you don't want to leave.

19
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,752
That'll make people overthink things.

20
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:30,953
You once said that you didn't care about other people's opinions.

21
00:02:31,159 --> 00:02:32,993
What if I want to care about them now?

22
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:41,793
After all, Father kept asking me who was better between you and Ji Ya.

23
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:45,113
I have to find some excuses for you

24
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:48,393
so that Father wouldn't misunderstand us again.

25
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:54,793
Am I right, Ji Ya?

26
00:03:08,719 --> 00:03:10,032
It's late now.

27
00:03:10,439 --> 00:03:11,993
Ji Ya, what are you doing here?

28
00:03:12,463 --> 00:03:13,923
You haven't returned even though it's late.

29
00:03:14,257 --> 00:03:16,495
I was worried about you. That's why I'm here.

30
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,192
Ji Ya, did you forget?

31
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:22,432
I love to indulge myself in pleasure with music and song every night.

32
00:03:22,599 --> 00:03:26,233
It's normal for me to return home late.

33
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,273
There's nothing to worry about.

34
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,953
Wu Zhen, your speech manner is as interesting as always.

35
00:03:32,129 --> 00:03:36,002
However, Mr. Mei, what are you doing here?

36
00:03:36,759 --> 00:03:40,432
Did you join Wu Zhen in her indulgence?

37
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:41,913
We bumped into each other by accident.

38
00:03:48,719 --> 00:03:52,432
Mr. Mei, it seems you have an affinity with my cousin.

39
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:55,912
Naturally, we have an affinity with each other.

40
00:03:59,031 --> 00:04:01,864
Wu Zhen, it's late now. Let's head home.

41
00:04:03,285 --> 00:04:04,426
Ji Ya, watch out!

42
00:04:11,319 --> 00:04:15,393
Mr. Pei, please be careful when you walk in the future.

43
00:04:15,714 --> 00:04:16,827
I have Wu Zhen with me.

44
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:19,713
You don't need to worry about me.

45
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,713
Chang'an isn't as nice as I think.

46
00:04:31,021 --> 00:04:32,495
Kunzhou is livelier.

47
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:34,184
What's so lively about the place?

48
00:04:34,759 --> 00:04:37,713
The people there are merely leading ordinary lives peacefully.

49
00:04:38,403 --> 00:04:41,357
Ji Ya, why don't you return there with me if you don't believe me?

50
00:04:42,256 --> 00:04:44,438
Kunzhou is flourishing with scenic beauty.

51
00:04:44,653 --> 00:04:46,120
It's filled with outstanding people as well.

52
00:04:46,231 --> 00:04:48,665
I'm sure you'll enjoy it.

53
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,072
Let me think about it for now.

54
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,272
I'm sleepy. I'll go to sleep first.

55
00:05:03,887 --> 00:05:07,920
Mr. Mei, do you think Wu Zhen will say yes to me?

56
00:05:09,656 --> 00:05:10,756
I don't know.

57
00:05:11,839 --> 00:05:12,844
I think

58
00:05:16,358 --> 00:05:17,481
she will.

59
00:05:19,279 --> 00:05:21,793
After all, ordinary people wouldn't be able

60
00:05:22,495 --> 00:05:26,233
to fancy her for over a decade like me.

61
00:05:26,704 --> 00:05:29,922
I treat her like a precious gem.

62
00:05:34,439 --> 00:05:38,072
By the way, you once gave us your blessings, right?

63
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:41,432
I assume you won't go back on your words.

64
00:05:42,151 --> 00:05:43,250
What I meant was,

65
00:05:44,393 --> 00:05:46,570
when two hearts are genuine toward one another,

66
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:48,353
fate itself will not betray them.

67
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:53,673
I just don't know if you two are genuine toward one another.

68
00:06:00,611 --> 00:06:03,021
(Mr. Pei from the Capital)

69
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,272
Mr. Pei, you may have this lantern.

70
00:06:17,857 --> 00:06:22,113
You should observe the road carefully before treading in the night again.

71
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,713
Young Master, please don't be angry.

72
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:42,872
He's no match for you.

73
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,432
He's truly annoying.

74
00:06:54,164 --> 00:06:55,717
Chang'an is so peaceful.

75
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:58,552
I wonder how the Ink Demon is faring at the moment.

76
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:28,277
I'll throw it into the Demon Prison to prevent any further trouble.

77
00:07:30,075 --> 00:07:32,669
Zhen, do you intend to spend the night at the Demon Market?

78
00:07:34,336 --> 00:07:35,769
I've gone through enough trouble today.

79
00:07:35,914 --> 00:07:37,587
I finally managed to bring it back.

80
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:39,112
I have to return home and rest now.

81
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,667
That's great.

82
00:07:52,399 --> 00:07:55,913
Shu, since you're heading to the Demon Prison,

83
00:07:56,135 --> 00:07:58,089
please retrieve something for me.

84
00:08:14,912 --> 00:08:15,947
Lord Shu.

85
00:08:18,984 --> 00:08:21,417
Lord Shu, are you heading to the Demon Prison?

86
00:08:21,668 --> 00:08:22,669
That's right.

87
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:25,312
Do you need me to accompany you? I'm free anyway.

88
00:08:26,298 --> 00:08:27,411
Are you free today?

89
00:08:28,839 --> 00:08:32,912
Serpent Lord grant me a two-day holiday after my encounter with An Bi Luo.

90
00:08:33,759 --> 00:08:35,272
I'm super free today.

91
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:36,963
That's why I'm taking a stroll.

92
00:08:39,228 --> 00:08:42,140
I hear there’s been some turmoil among humans. Is Cat Lord doing well?

93
00:08:43,815 --> 00:08:45,849
Someone has cast a dark spell upon this spell block.

94
00:08:46,068 --> 00:08:47,701
Luckily, the item has been retrieved.

95
00:08:48,056 --> 00:08:49,330
Cat Lord is uninjured.

96
00:08:49,799 --> 00:08:53,113
It's just an ink block. Did it actually flip Chang'an upside down?

97
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,713
What? Are you a dog demon?

98
00:09:00,879 --> 00:09:03,552
Something's off with the smell.

99
00:09:03,727 --> 00:09:04,897
What do you mean?

100
00:09:14,879 --> 00:09:16,032
It's Kirin Horn Gum.

101
00:09:17,016 --> 00:09:18,115
Kirin Horn Gum?

102
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:23,632
No wonder this ink block has taken form through sorcery with such prowess.

103
00:09:24,463 --> 00:09:26,320
I'm afraid there's something more to it than meets the eye.

104
00:10:13,016 --> 00:10:14,100
Elder Bai?

105
00:10:16,823 --> 00:10:19,777
Lord Shu, are you here to memorize the Demon Law again?

106
00:10:22,096 --> 00:10:24,648
It's located on the 1st floor.

107
00:10:30,008 --> 00:10:31,025
If so,

108
00:10:31,173 --> 00:10:33,246
you may take a look around.

109
00:10:33,424 --> 00:10:34,616
I'll resume my duties.

110
00:10:34,799 --> 00:10:39,672
Elder Bai, I thought handling the Demon Prison was a tough job.

111
00:10:40,279 --> 00:10:42,113
I never expected you to slack off here.

112
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:44,272
Lord Shu, you misunderstood me.

113
00:10:44,436 --> 00:10:46,677
I'm always busy with my duties, you know?

114
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:49,512
On which level was Xuan Hui imprisoned?

115
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,833
He's on the 3rd floor.

116
00:10:56,039 --> 00:10:58,032
Elder Bai, please lead the way.

117
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:00,782
Let's go.

118
00:11:07,292 --> 00:11:09,329
There are three levels in the Demon Prison.

119
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,872
The graver the sin, the deeper the confinement.

120
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,473
At first, Xuan Hui was sent to the 1st floor.

121
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:17,352
He was sent to the 2nd floor after escaping prison thrice.

122
00:11:17,433 --> 00:11:18,473
Lord Shu! Let me out!

123
00:11:18,554 --> 00:11:21,223
Now, he's on the 3rd floor after escaping prison six times.

124
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:25,433
I assume we'll send him away after if he gets captured again.

125
00:11:26,039 --> 00:11:27,593
This is his cell.

126
00:11:35,112 --> 00:11:38,024
Lord Shu, why are you taking Xuan Hui's Mirror of Clarity?

127
00:11:39,039 --> 00:11:42,152
The Mirror of Clarity records the past sins of demons.

128
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:45,872
I took it so that I can capture Xuan Hui as soon as possible.

129
00:11:46,519 --> 00:11:48,073
You don't need to inquire about it.

130
00:11:48,639 --> 00:11:51,993
You're right. It has nothing to do with me anyway. I don't want to know.

131
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,752
Who's inside?

132
00:12:05,032 --> 00:12:06,078
No one.

133
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:14,353
This is the most heavily guarded cell in the entire Demon Prison.

134
00:12:14,559 --> 00:12:16,473
It can seal away one's demonic power.

135
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:20,073
Sinister Fiend Infant launched a sudden assault on Chang'an 18 years ago.

136
00:12:20,519 --> 00:12:22,433
Initially, they wanted to capture it and send it to this cell.

137
00:12:22,799 --> 00:12:26,193
But it was killed by the previous Cat Lord. It remained vacant until now.

138
00:12:27,559 --> 00:12:30,552
Does that sinister fiend have any aides?

139
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:32,993
Who knows?

140
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:35,193
The master is already dead.

141
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:38,917
Any surviving followers of the demon ought to have been wiped out by now.

142
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,233
I see.

143
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,313
Lord Qiang Yi!

144
00:13:10,879 --> 00:13:13,160
Sinister Fiend Infant once proclaimed himself

145
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:16,243
the greatest god in the entire demon realm.

146
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:18,073
He said he would take over everything.

147
00:13:18,799 --> 00:13:22,272
In the end? He was reduced to ashes.

148
00:13:28,759 --> 00:13:30,353
The Sinister Fiend Infant, huh?

149
00:13:30,811 --> 00:13:32,125
So what if he's a god?

150
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:33,593
So what if he's me?

151
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:35,593
Right now, in this world,

152
00:13:36,191 --> 00:13:41,272
she's much more precious than you and me.

153
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:48,833
What? Kirin Horn Gum?

154
00:13:50,128 --> 00:13:51,277
What a coincidence, huh?

155
00:13:51,748 --> 00:13:54,261
A piece of Kirin Horn Gum went missing during the humans' Incense Assembly.

156
00:13:54,488 --> 00:13:56,282
And now, we've found one.

157
00:13:57,112 --> 00:13:59,105
It seems Chang'an is quite prosperous.

158
00:14:00,090 --> 00:14:03,764
Ling Xiao, has it ever occurred to you

159
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:07,513
that those two might be the same piece?

160
00:14:08,519 --> 00:14:09,713
Those two might be the same piece, huh?

161
00:14:12,644 --> 00:14:13,716
You have a point.

162
00:14:13,854 --> 00:14:15,387
No wonder Huang Yi and the guys

163
00:14:15,606 --> 00:14:17,920
couldn't find the missing piece after the Incense Assembly.

164
00:14:18,759 --> 00:14:20,269
That's the reason.

165
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,953
The Kirin Horn Gum is related to the Ink Demons.

166
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,759
We should cover it up with another piece.

167
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:27,520
We must stop the Jinwu Guards from investigating the case.

168
00:14:29,664 --> 00:14:30,687
Golden Roc!

169
00:14:31,977 --> 00:14:32,977
Coming.

170
00:14:34,458 --> 00:14:36,655
Lady Hu Zhu, what do you need?

171
00:14:36,823 --> 00:14:38,261
Go search around the Demon Market.

172
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:40,272
I need a new piece of Kirin Horn Gum.

173
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:41,989
All right!

174
00:14:44,879 --> 00:14:48,313
Haggling with Golden Roc has proven to be tough lately.

175
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:49,792
Why is she being so nice today?

176
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:53,100
It's because I've taken over this tavern.

177
00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:54,507
Now, I'm the owner.

178
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:55,953
You've taken over this tavern?

179
00:14:56,271 --> 00:14:57,332
When?

180
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,196
When I said there were no discounts for you.

181
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:00,312
Wait a minute...

182
00:15:00,734 --> 00:15:01,817
- Who said I...   - I don't lack customers.

183
00:15:01,909 --> 00:15:02,909
Lady Hu Zhu.

184
00:15:03,028 --> 00:15:05,901
I managed to find this at the general store after much trouble.

185
00:15:06,072 --> 00:15:08,824
This is the only piece in the entire Demon Market.

186
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,792
The only piece, huh?

187
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:13,713
It must be costly, then.

188
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:15,752
It's free.

189
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:17,645
It's free?

190
00:15:19,032 --> 00:15:23,269
It's because I own the general store as well.

191
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,593
You own the general store as well?

192
00:15:27,399 --> 00:15:28,672
What other shops do you own?

193
00:15:29,039 --> 00:15:30,353
What else is there that I unaware of?

194
00:15:39,731 --> 00:15:41,237
You intend to look for Liu Tai Zhen?

195
00:15:42,017 --> 00:15:43,250
That's right, Miss Zhen.

196
00:15:43,583 --> 00:15:46,056
Where exactly has Lady Liu gone to recuperate?

197
00:15:46,154 --> 00:15:49,147
The Liu Residence said she had been away for many days with no news of her.

198
00:15:49,416 --> 00:15:52,129
And now, there are rumors of demons in Chang'an.

199
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:54,953
I'm worried that Lady Liu might be in danger.

200
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:58,512
The rumors of demons have been quelled.

201
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:04,272
Even so, that doesn't mean there are no demons there.

202
00:16:04,919 --> 00:16:07,433
Although Lady Liu is fond of tales of demons and the uncanny,

203
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,633
that's one thing.

204
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:12,573
One has to be careful in the event that they encounter a demon.

205
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:15,272
Don't worry. She'll be fine.

206
00:16:15,933 --> 00:16:16,967
Miss Zhen,

207
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:19,648
she should've returned long ago according to the date you mentioned.

208
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,313
I guess so.

209
00:16:27,799 --> 00:16:29,993
This won't do. I have to look for her.

210
00:16:31,159 --> 00:16:32,313
Stop it already!

211
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,233
Miss Zhen, tell me. Where is she now?

212
00:16:36,919 --> 00:16:38,026
To the south of Chang'an.

213
00:16:38,896 --> 00:16:39,964
Mount Luwei.

214
00:16:44,759 --> 00:16:45,792
Thank you, Mr. Shu.

215
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:51,175
Serpent Lord hasn't returned yet. We should send someone to look for her.

216
00:16:51,609 --> 00:16:53,202
Even so, we shouldn't have sent Si.

217
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:56,872
There are numerous demons there. It's unsafe for him.

218
00:16:58,279 --> 00:17:01,032
Zhen, you only care about one's safety.

219
00:17:01,399 --> 00:17:05,393
You had no idea that how lucky it is for one to fancy someone else.

220
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:08,352
It's much more important than surviving alone.

221
00:17:10,519 --> 00:17:13,072
It's nothing more than treating others

222
00:17:13,342 --> 00:17:14,775
as I would wish to be treated.

223
00:17:38,718 --> 00:17:42,071
(Duke Wu's Residence)

224
00:18:03,458 --> 00:18:04,536
Come.

225
00:18:04,759 --> 00:18:06,112
Let's eat.

226
00:18:17,139 --> 00:18:18,372
Mr. Mei.

227
00:18:19,359 --> 00:18:22,072
What's the matter? Is there something wrong with the food?

228
00:18:22,728 --> 00:18:23,777
That's not it.

229
00:18:24,039 --> 00:18:28,233
I just never expected breakfast to be so scrumptious.

230
00:18:29,359 --> 00:18:32,473
Mr. Mei, you're used to having plain food. You might have no idea.

231
00:18:33,079 --> 00:18:34,953
My uncle-in-law is a duke after all.

232
00:18:35,359 --> 00:18:37,953
Therefore, this is a normal breakfast for him.

233
00:19:05,559 --> 00:19:06,873
Zhen, hurry.

234
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,397
Join us for breakfast.

235
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,592
What were you guys chatting about?

236
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:15,877
Mr. Mei was shocked by the scrumptious breakfast you guys serve here.

237
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:18,953
I was preparing to tell Uncle-in-law about a reclusive master.

238
00:19:19,599 --> 00:19:21,312
He's an expert in food.

239
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:24,873
I'll invite him here so that he can look after Wu Zhen.

240
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,752
There's no need for the trouble.

241
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:32,352
What's the matter? Ji Ya, do you think the food we serve isn't good enough?

242
00:19:32,548 --> 00:19:33,592
Of course not.

243
00:19:34,279 --> 00:19:38,112
Since I intend to marry you, naturally, I have to care for you.

244
00:19:38,759 --> 00:19:40,633
I want you to lead a better life.

245
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,832
So, Ji Ya,

246
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:50,112
a few days ago, you said you wanted to marry Wu Zhen.

247
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:53,077
Were you serious about that?

248
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:54,220
Of course.

249
00:19:55,153 --> 00:19:57,041
Mother's health hasn't been the best lately.

250
00:19:57,254 --> 00:19:58,319
She intends to step down as the female head.

251
00:19:58,408 --> 00:20:01,520
Therefore, if she marries into our family, she'll be the female head.

252
00:20:02,319 --> 00:20:05,953
I, Pei Ji Ya, hereby swear that I will never take a concubine.

253
00:20:06,519 --> 00:20:08,673
That's great. Not taking concubines is a great practice.

254
00:20:09,079 --> 00:20:11,352
Seems like you're sincere toward Zhen.

255
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:15,792
So, Mr. Mei, do you have anything to say to that?

256
00:20:19,247 --> 00:20:20,293
No.

257
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:23,433
Do you intend to take concubines?

258
00:20:24,079 --> 00:20:25,153
Duke Wu, you misunderstood me.

259
00:20:25,759 --> 00:20:28,473
I have simply never considered marriage.

260
00:20:34,039 --> 00:20:37,193
If so, Mr. Mei, what do you think

261
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:40,112
about my marriage with Ji Ya?

262
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,633
Lady Wu Zhen, I think only your own opinion matters.

263
00:20:48,359 --> 00:20:49,405
Duke!

264
00:20:53,319 --> 00:20:55,317
Greetings, Duke, Your Highness.

265
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:57,312
Eunuch Feng? What are you doing here?

266
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,673
His Majesty and Her Majesty have invited you two to the palace.

267
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:06,473
Don't tell me they found out that I bought artifacts again.

268
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,112
Duke, don't worry. This isn't related to you.

269
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:12,713
It's related to the princess.

270
00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:15,097
Yuan Zhen?

271
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:19,832
That white tea tree in the imperial garden is the princess’s favorite.

272
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,473
But it wilted out of the blue.

273
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:25,713
Thus, His Majesty and Her Majesty arranged for it to be chopped down.

274
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:30,393
Her Highness was depressed over it even until now.

275
00:21:34,359 --> 00:21:36,633
- Let's go.   - Be careful.

276
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,153
Young Master, it's time for your medicine.

277
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:57,673
Mr. Mei, I didn't expect your hobby to be something like spying on someone.

278
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:02,633
How would I know that you were up to something shady had I not done so?

279
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:05,072
Look at what you're saying.

280
00:24:05,559 --> 00:24:09,312
I was always thankful to you for rescuing me at the inn.

281
00:24:10,519 --> 00:24:13,153
Mr. Mei, may I know how I've offended you?

282
00:24:13,359 --> 00:24:15,433
Why are you trying to frame me,

283
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,032
spread rumors about me, and sow discord in Chang'an?

284
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:20,713
How am I framing you?

285
00:24:21,559 --> 00:24:23,993
Tales of the strange and supernatural have existed since ancient times.

286
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:27,713
For some reason, the people of Chang'an have been speaking of them again,

287
00:24:28,039 --> 00:24:29,433
but they are nothing more than rumors.

288
00:24:30,279 --> 00:24:33,512
Why would you come to me with such a seemingly serious inquiry?

289
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:35,873
Mr. Pei, I'm sure you know why the best.

290
00:24:44,519 --> 00:24:47,512
Keeper Shi, why don't you inspect my room, then?

291
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:50,272
Mr. Pei, I just want to give you a reminder.

292
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:52,352
Those who tread in the dark

293
00:24:54,759 --> 00:24:56,913
will be consumed by it one day.

294
00:25:25,856 --> 00:25:26,948
Young Master,

295
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:29,913
it'll be troublesome for us now that Mr. Pei has found out about us.

296
00:25:30,822 --> 00:25:31,918
It doesn't matter.

297
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:36,072
I'm not keeping him alive anyway.

298
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:48,393
All right now. Stop crying.

299
00:25:49,633 --> 00:25:50,761
Yuan Zhen, be a good girl.

300
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:53,249
This white tea tree has always been strange.

301
00:25:53,329 --> 00:25:55,792
It blooms and wilts for no reason.

302
00:25:56,265 --> 00:25:57,422
It might be cursed.

303
00:25:57,559 --> 00:25:58,606
Indeed.

304
00:26:00,039 --> 00:26:01,633
He's not cursed.

305
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:04,193
Don't touch him!

306
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,027
But...

307
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:09,512
Even if we don't chop it off,

308
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:13,792
it wouldn't have survived in this state anyway.

309
00:26:15,033 --> 00:26:16,058
That can't be.

310
00:26:16,839 --> 00:26:18,473
He'll recover.

311
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:21,352
He'll bloom again for me.

312
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:25,233
He said that he would keep me company forever.

313
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:27,032
All right now.

314
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:29,352
It's just an ordinary white tea tree.

315
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:34,476
If you like it that much, I'll instruct our servants to plant more of them.

316
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:35,752
Yeah, that's right.

317
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:38,181
It's different.

318
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:39,993
It's different!

319
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,032
He's different from other trees!

320
00:26:44,319 --> 00:26:45,433
What is she...

321
00:26:45,519 --> 00:26:47,832
How are they any different?

322
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,592
Yuan Zhen, stop crying.

323
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:54,233
Look at what I've brought you.

324
00:26:57,112 --> 00:26:58,158
Take a look.

325
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,713
- Isn't it interesting?   - Not at all.

326
00:27:06,375 --> 00:27:07,377
It's interesting.

327
00:27:07,559 --> 00:27:08,752
It's not!

328
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:11,032
How is this not interesting?

329
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:15,233
She's close to you.

330
00:27:15,329 --> 00:27:16,781
Hurry and persuade her to stop.

331
00:27:16,862 --> 00:27:17,890
With matters of state pressing,

332
00:27:17,971 --> 00:27:19,836
Sister, Brother-in-law, you two should resume your duties.

333
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,473
Leave the rest to me.

334
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:23,150
I'll leave her to you now.

335
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:27,153
All right. Let's go.

336
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,237
All of you, leave now.

337
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:34,993
We don't need you all. Go now.

338
00:27:37,599 --> 00:27:38,953
Seems like you don't need me either.

339
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:41,423
Aunt.

340
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,633
You can understand my feelings, right?

341
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:46,193
I can.

342
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,913
Yuan Zhen, I remember

343
00:27:51,559 --> 00:27:53,673
that white tea tree came from

344
00:27:53,753 --> 00:27:57,993
the southern journey you once took with your parents, right?

345
00:28:00,222 --> 00:28:05,215
If so, can you tell me what happened before the journey?

346
00:28:05,368 --> 00:28:07,280
What made you fall in love with that white tea tree?

347
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:15,023
Mother!

348
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,153
Father!

349
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:22,032
Mother!

350
00:28:23,599 --> 00:28:24,752
Father!

351
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:38,233
I was in the woods during nightfall.

352
00:28:38,519 --> 00:28:41,512
He scared the beasts away and protected me.

353
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:51,112
Your Highness!

354
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:53,673
Your Highness!

355
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:54,993
Your Highness!

356
00:28:56,119 --> 00:28:58,633
Your Highness! We finally found you!

357
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:00,520
Hurry!

358
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:03,352
His Majesty and Her Majesty were worried sick about you.

359
00:29:04,279 --> 00:29:06,713
Your Highness, are you hurt?

360
00:29:08,359 --> 00:29:10,597
What are you doing here? Let's hurry and head back.

361
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:11,699
Come, let's go.

362
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:15,112
We cannot leave yet. He saved me.

363
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:18,157
I think he's sick. We have to save him.

364
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:19,752
It saved you?

365
00:29:21,359 --> 00:29:24,157
But we don't have a gardener with us.

366
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,953
Your Highness, we should leave for now.

367
00:29:27,099 --> 00:29:28,432
If so, let's bring him back to the palace.

368
00:29:28,512 --> 00:29:30,673
I'll hire the best gardener for him.

369
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:33,633
All right. We'll make sure it survives.

370
00:29:34,079 --> 00:29:35,673
Your Highness, let's head back first.

371
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:43,926
Aunt.

372
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,046
I know.

373
00:29:46,839 --> 00:29:50,193
Even the best gardener said he couldn't do anything about him now.

374
00:29:51,375 --> 00:29:55,568
Now, he's truly gone.

375
00:30:00,975 --> 00:30:02,020
Take a look.

376
00:30:03,595 --> 00:30:04,653
What is this?

377
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:13,060
This is...

378
00:30:15,313 --> 00:30:16,461
It's him.

379
00:30:42,676 --> 00:30:46,070
You sacrificed yourself just to save Yuan Zhen.

380
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:50,312
Now, you're nearing death, and your soul will vanish soon.

381
00:30:51,519 --> 00:30:52,633
Do you regret it?

382
00:30:56,231 --> 00:31:00,024
I never regretted saving Her Highness.

383
00:31:04,599 --> 00:31:05,698
Of course,

384
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:10,072
I can transfer your spirit into an object and present it to Yuan Zhen.

385
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:12,752
You guys can keep each other company forever.

386
00:31:21,599 --> 00:31:22,953
Cat Lord, thank you for realizing my wish.

387
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:26,953
I'm willing to transfer my spirit into an object.

388
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:07,393
Flower of the Beheaded, huh?

389
00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:20,357
Is this a flower?

390
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,993
Let me put it on for you, okay?

391
00:33:06,069 --> 00:33:09,421
When I was traveling, I missed my home.

392
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:12,153
I missed Yuan Zhen.

393
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:16,072
Your Majesty, it'll surely be lively

394
00:33:16,839 --> 00:33:19,153
if you're able to give Yuan Zhen a younger brother.

395
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:23,792
It would be livelier

396
00:33:24,296 --> 00:33:25,849
if Zhen gets married and forms her own family.

397
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:29,959
I heard that Mr. Pei and Mr. Mei

398
00:33:30,039 --> 00:33:31,873
are living at your residence for the time being.

399
00:33:32,519 --> 00:33:35,592
Father, have you seen them? What do you think about them?

400
00:33:35,857 --> 00:33:36,912
I have.

401
00:33:37,309 --> 00:33:39,302
But, you see,

402
00:33:39,703 --> 00:33:41,617
it's difficult to choose a son-in-law.

403
00:33:44,119 --> 00:33:49,633
But after my thorough consideration,

404
00:33:50,113 --> 00:33:51,193
I think

405
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:54,312
my nephew from the Pei family is better.

406
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:57,032
The key point is that he won't take any concubines.

407
00:33:57,799 --> 00:34:01,633
So, Mr. Mei intends to take concubines, huh?

408
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:06,433
That's not it.

409
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,152
He just doesn't want to get married.

410
00:34:09,239 --> 00:34:10,306
Why is that?

411
00:34:12,094 --> 00:34:14,607
He's parentless with no wealth reserves.

412
00:34:15,039 --> 00:34:17,592
I assume he cannot take on the burden of marriage.

413
00:34:18,519 --> 00:34:22,672
I've seen Mr. Pei before. He's an outstanding man.

414
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:26,592
Father, please don't be reckless.

415
00:34:27,239 --> 00:34:31,793
If Zhen is to get married, she must choose someone she fancies.

416
00:34:32,199 --> 00:34:35,512
They must be able to keep each other company for the rest of their lives.

417
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:08,232
Tell us. What do you think about that cousin of yours?

418
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:16,753
It is truly a blessing to have someone by my side.

419
00:35:17,951 --> 00:35:19,067
Just look at her.

420
00:35:19,199 --> 00:35:21,512
Even Zhen thinks that her cousin from the Pei family is better.

421
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:22,713
Why is she

422
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:24,917
this easy to persuade now?

423
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,112
You have no idea, huh?

424
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:29,473
Zhen has finally grown up.

425
00:35:32,159 --> 00:35:33,592
She has finally grown up.

426
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:39,112
Father, there's one more thing I need to trouble you.

427
00:35:48,161 --> 00:35:51,239
(Duke Wu's Residence)

428
00:35:56,519 --> 00:35:59,433
Guys, sorry for the wait.

429
00:36:00,199 --> 00:36:01,250
Uncle-in-law.

430
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:02,662
Come!

431
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:04,793
Pour us some liquor.

432
00:36:09,199 --> 00:36:11,278
Duke Wu, please forgive me. I can't take alcohol.

433
00:36:11,361 --> 00:36:13,712
I know that.

434
00:36:14,119 --> 00:36:16,672
I know you can't hold your liquor.

435
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:19,556
But this isn't alcohol. It's called Apricot Gold.

436
00:36:19,639 --> 00:36:21,313
It's a fruit drink.

437
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:23,993
You should try it first.

438
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:29,753
Dear nephew, don't tell me you can't drink either.

439
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:33,592
Zhen is quite good at drinking.

440
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:35,416
Come.

441
00:36:36,417 --> 00:36:37,486
Bottoms up.

442
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:39,757
Duke Wu, my master isn't good at drinking...

443
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:40,873
That's none of your business.

444
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:51,340
Come.

445
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:53,433
Try it.

446
00:36:53,519 --> 00:36:55,232
Come on, show me some respect.

447
00:37:01,559 --> 00:37:02,610
What do you think?

448
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:06,152
Isn’t it rich in aroma, smooth, with a lingering aftertaste?

449
00:37:06,559 --> 00:37:08,953
Even the finest nectar could be no better than this.

450
00:37:09,199 --> 00:37:10,236
What do you think?

451
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:16,481
What do you think?

452
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:21,232
The aroma is pure and refreshing with a hint of sweetness and tartness.

453
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:22,873
It's excellent indeed.

454
00:37:23,519 --> 00:37:26,313
Dear nephew, since you're a good drinker,

455
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:28,672
let's drink until we drop today.

456
00:37:28,904 --> 00:37:31,032
We have plenty of liquor here.

457
00:37:55,150 --> 00:37:58,013
Uncle-in-law, regarding Wu Zhen...

458
00:37:58,239 --> 00:37:59,433
She's a good drinker!

459
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:02,433
Drink up! This is Apricot Gold.

460
00:38:04,719 --> 00:38:05,753
What are they doing?

461
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:10,313
Duke Wu said he would drink with Mr. Pei and Mr. Mei until they drop.

462
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:13,032
He told me to relay this message to you upon your return.

463
00:38:13,679 --> 00:38:15,953
Both of them are drunk. As to which of them to look after,

464
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:18,032
Lady Wu Zhen, you may decide that yourself.

465
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:21,433
Father is trying to test me here.

466
00:38:23,039 --> 00:38:25,152
It's quite the intricate plan.

467
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:26,993
I don't think he came up with it.

468
00:38:30,519 --> 00:38:31,632
I'm so dizzy.

469
00:38:32,639 --> 00:38:34,833
I'm drunk!

470
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,232
I guess it's Sister.

471
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:40,512
I'm so dizzy!

472
00:38:41,142 --> 00:38:42,192
Duke!

473
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:44,592
I'm drunk!

474
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,032
Zhen, you've returned.

475
00:38:49,719 --> 00:38:52,232
Both of them have drunk quite a lot.

476
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:55,313
Look after them.

477
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:58,960
You,

478
00:38:59,519 --> 00:39:00,753
you, and you,

479
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:02,038
come with me.

480
00:39:03,039 --> 00:39:04,592
- Slowly.   - I'm so dizzy.

481
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:07,001
I'm so dizzy.

482
00:39:07,159 --> 00:39:08,833
Ji Ya, let me send you to your room.

483
00:39:19,159 --> 00:39:20,996
Mr. Mei, I'll send you to your room.

484
00:39:21,079 --> 00:39:23,672
Miss Ming Zhuang, just ignore me.

485
00:39:24,039 --> 00:39:25,095
You may resume your duties.

486
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:43,953
What did I say again?

487
00:39:44,639 --> 00:39:49,672
I knew Zhen cared more about her cousin.

488
00:40:00,039 --> 00:40:01,101
Wu Zhen?

489
00:40:05,599 --> 00:40:08,473
Do you know my feelings for you?

490
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,592
Of course I know.

491
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:18,152
Rest well. Let's go out together tomorrow.

492
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,072
Mr. Mei, I thought you didn't drink.

493
00:41:13,639 --> 00:41:15,353
You seem like you can hold your liquor pretty well.

494
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:19,473
But you're wasting the liquor if you're drinking it as such.

495
00:41:20,559 --> 00:41:22,473
You have to savor Apricot Gold slowly

496
00:41:23,079 --> 00:41:25,112
to enjoy its taste.

497
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:27,552
And, it has a strong kick.

498
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:31,632
I'm afraid you're drinking too much.

499
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:33,632
I thought you already sent your cousin to his room.

500
00:41:34,199 --> 00:41:35,480
What are you doing here again?
