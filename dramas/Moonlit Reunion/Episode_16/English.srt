1
00:01:27,133 --> 00:01:31,000
(Moonlit Reunion)

2
00:01:31,121 --> 00:01:34,000
(Episode 16)

3
00:01:42,067 --> 00:01:43,140
The Reminiscent Fragrance.

4
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:49,719
Pass it to me.

5
00:01:55,079 --> 00:01:57,519
Little sickly! Little sickly!

6
00:01:57,599 --> 00:01:59,201
It's not that we won't play with you...

7
00:01:59,281 --> 00:02:01,393
You just can't keep up!

8
00:02:01,519 --> 00:02:03,600
Huff and puff, no strength enough,

9
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,553
trip and fall, can't get up!

10
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,673
Huff and puff, no strength enough,

11
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,632
trip and fall, can't get up!

12
00:02:09,719 --> 00:02:11,632
Huff and puff, no strength enough,

13
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:13,519
trip and fall, can't get up!

14
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:14,632
Huff and puff...

15
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,873
Who did that?

16
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:22,321
He can't play with you, but I can.

17
00:02:22,401 --> 00:02:23,993
You?

18
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,632
Run! Run!

19
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:39,152
I heard you're my cousin.

20
00:02:39,719 --> 00:02:41,073
Let's mix fragrances together.

21
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,512
I want plum blossoms and azaleas.

22
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,080
Is this enough?

23
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:59,273
More. And some Lacha tea leaves too.

24
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,993
Wild turmeric, patchouli, and licorice.

25
00:03:03,919 --> 00:03:04,919
And honey.

26
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,080
(Marvelous Grade)

27
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,273
Young Master Pei, you've come from so far

28
00:03:20,479 --> 00:03:21,912
to join this grand event.

29
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,936
Yet why did you present a fragrance made of such

30
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:27,880
common ingredients?

31
00:03:28,093 --> 00:03:29,486
You don't understand this,

32
00:03:29,879 --> 00:03:32,592
but this fragrance is meant for one person alone.

33
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,793
Your Highness, do you like it?

34
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,680
Yes.

35
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:44,632
It carries the scent of our garden in full bloom,

36
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:46,039
the springtime of years past.

37
00:03:47,319 --> 00:03:48,319
But still,

38
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,720
you spent so long preparing for this fragrance contest,

39
00:03:50,759 --> 00:03:52,273
and journeyed all this way,

40
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:54,760
only to present a scent of memories.

41
00:03:54,919 --> 00:03:55,953
It seems such a waste.

42
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,273
I've heard it said of poets,

43
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:00,152
some write for the world,

44
00:04:00,392 --> 00:04:02,306
while others write for just one person.

45
00:04:03,639 --> 00:04:05,553
I don't seek to please the world,

46
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,880
only hers.

47
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:22,353
And now, a peerless fragrance,

48
00:04:23,053 --> 00:04:26,046
crafted by none other than Master An Bi Luo himself.

49
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:29,632
Presented as the grand finale of the Grand Aromatics Competition,

50
00:04:30,439 --> 00:04:32,799
I invite you all to witness it together.

51
00:04:32,879 --> 00:04:34,113
A fragrance by Master An.

52
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,800
Master An!

53
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,520
He hasn't personally crafted a scent in nearly three years!

54
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:40,793
This trip was worth it after all.

55
00:04:41,399 --> 00:04:42,399
Indeed.

56
00:05:16,439 --> 00:05:18,233
That's a one-horned rhino censer.

57
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,512
It's such a large piece.

58
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,632
The carving is exquisite.

59
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,993
Truly a rare sight.

60
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:31,632
This censer is carved from the horn of a Linyi one-horned rhino,

61
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:32,993
exceedingly rare.

62
00:05:33,439 --> 00:05:34,632
Yet its worth is nothing

63
00:05:35,079 --> 00:05:38,113
compared to the fragrance it holds.

64
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:40,303
What is the name of the fragrance?

65
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,199
The Spirit Fragrance!

66
00:05:43,279 --> 00:05:44,432
The Spirit Fragrance...

67
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,720
So this is the legendary Spirit Fragrance.

68
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,913
I heard this is Master An's new creation.

69
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,896
He condensed the essence of nature into this scent.

70
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,656
When burned, its aroma ascends to the heavens,

71
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,113
and you can smell it for miles.

72
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,640
They say those who breathe it in year after year

73
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:02,752
will stay young and gain endless vitality.

74
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,793
What recipe was it made from?

75
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,632
Its base is phoenix feathers.

76
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:36,200
Then, powdered dragon scale.

77
00:06:36,439 --> 00:06:38,679
Then blend with a hundred other aromatics

78
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:40,999
like styrax, benzoin, ambergris, and more

79
00:06:41,079 --> 00:06:44,272
Left to steep and mature for a thousand days.

80
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:47,553
Phoenix feathers and dragon scales!

81
00:06:48,359 --> 00:06:49,519
Pure theatrics.

82
00:06:49,639 --> 00:06:51,832
Those mythical things don't really exist.

83
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,040
Don't speak that way about Master An.

84
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,153
Everything he does has meaning.

85
00:08:12,199 --> 00:08:13,952
Is Master An being serious?

86
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:15,752
Why does it smell like poop?

87
00:08:16,273 --> 00:08:17,273
Don't say that.

88
00:08:17,879 --> 00:08:19,312
How can you question Master An?

89
00:08:19,639 --> 00:08:21,113
His creations

90
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,634
are beyond compare.

91
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:26,192
Our noses just aren't refined enough

92
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:28,153
to appreciate it.

93
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,233
It really stinks.

94
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:56,800
Master Xie.

95
00:08:59,759 --> 00:09:02,193
What do you think of my fragrance?

96
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:03,840
Well...

97
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:09,872
It smells horrible.

98
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,233
It is certainly uncommon.

99
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,473
There is an...

100
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,672
An earthy scent,

101
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:25,113
like spring sunlight melting the snows of winter.

102
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,712
The first breath of new life.

103
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:31,000
Marvelous! Truly marvelous!

104
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:33,640
That's right! Marvelous!

105
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,456
It's been years since I last visited Chang'an.

106
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:37,880
Has the local taste become so peculiar?

107
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:40,360
Marvelous! How marvelous!

108
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,433
Yes, marvelous!

109
00:09:44,159 --> 00:09:49,392
What grade do you give it then?

110
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:55,520
How could we presume to judge a fragrance

111
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,280
crafted by your own hand?

112
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,193
What grade?

113
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:05,159
Well, of course...

114
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,193
It is Supreme Grade!

115
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,240
Supreme Grade!

116
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,433
What about you, Master Gao?

117
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,680
(Supreme Grade)

118
00:10:44,919 --> 00:10:46,073
Lady Wu.

119
00:10:48,039 --> 00:10:49,113
What do you think?

120
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,632
I think...

121
00:10:54,799 --> 00:10:56,799
The earlier blends may have had their differences,

122
00:10:57,159 --> 00:10:58,799
but at least they smelled like fragrance.

123
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,713
Master An, yours...

124
00:11:01,399 --> 00:11:02,552
What about mine?

125
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:08,920
It reeks of a barnyard.

126
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,833
Barnyard?

127
00:11:14,639 --> 00:11:15,792
Am I wrong?

128
00:11:17,759 --> 00:11:19,353
Still as the same as she was little,

129
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:22,152
sparing no one's pride.

130
00:11:22,639 --> 00:11:23,792
What do you think, people?

131
00:11:26,759 --> 00:11:28,353
It does smell of manure.

132
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:32,193
Yes, it smells like dung.

133
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,672
See? Not just me.

134
00:11:38,799 --> 00:11:40,993
You snot-nosed brats!

135
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,463
You know nothing!

136
00:11:45,039 --> 00:11:46,233
The Spirit Fragrance...

137
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,152
Do you have any idea

138
00:11:51,159 --> 00:11:53,113
the effort I poured into making it?

139
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:56,473
The dragon scales are pangolin scales.

140
00:11:56,559 --> 00:11:59,552
The phoenix feathers are plucked from white geese!

141
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:03,640
Ordinary, yes, but the method of plucking is an art.

142
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:06,280
The more terrified and anguished the gosling,

143
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,679
the feathers from under its beak

144
00:12:07,759 --> 00:12:11,632
produce a richer, more profound scent!

145
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,680
By the rising purifying intent,

146
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:28,912
all spirits align!

147
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,632
By the shattering darkness,

148
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,392
all demons disperse!

149
00:13:34,519 --> 00:13:35,519
Break!

150
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:41,960
Where is Zhen?

151
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:06,953
I know your pain.

152
00:14:11,679 --> 00:14:14,560
An Bi Luo has spilled too much innocent blood.

153
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:18,233
You possessed him to stop the slaughter and to seek revenge.

154
00:14:18,559 --> 00:14:20,272
I understand that.

155
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:23,152
But this body is still his.

156
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:25,800
Even if venting your hatred through him gives you relief,

157
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:27,912
it's only temporary.

158
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:30,840
How...

159
00:14:33,399 --> 00:14:34,672
How do you know this?

160
00:14:35,845 --> 00:14:37,598
I am the Cat Lord of Chang'an's Demon City.

161
00:14:38,759 --> 00:14:40,039
The mortal realm is complicated.

162
00:14:40,799 --> 00:14:41,799
Why don't you...

163
00:14:44,679 --> 00:14:46,113
Return with me to the Demon City.

164
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,900
I'll find you a body of your own at The Skin Shop,

165
00:14:49,033 --> 00:14:50,078
and help you cultivate.

166
00:14:50,159 --> 00:14:51,600
I will see that he is punished.

167
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:53,360
You will have your justice.

168
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:13,360
The Demon City...

169
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:16,039
Cat Lord...

170
00:15:19,759 --> 00:15:20,759
My lord,

171
00:15:21,039 --> 00:15:22,199
since this matter is settled,

172
00:15:22,406 --> 00:15:23,846
should we return to the City at once

173
00:15:23,879 --> 00:15:25,479
or explain things to those people first?

174
00:15:27,879 --> 00:15:28,879
My lord!

175
00:15:29,399 --> 00:15:30,399
Ling Xiao!

176
00:15:34,279 --> 00:15:37,272
So you're still going to hand me over to them!

177
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,552
No sign of Her Highness on the east!

178
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:41,360
No sign of Her Highness on the west!

179
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,639
- No sign of Her Highness on the north! - Enough!

180
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:45,800
Report only when you've found her!

181
00:15:50,279 --> 00:15:52,552
You are the Cat Lord? You don't even have any power!

182
00:15:52,679 --> 00:15:54,056
You're a fraud!

183
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,360
Over there!

184
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,440
Zhen...

185
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,353
Hang on, how did they get across?

186
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,034
Did they fly there?

187
00:16:12,759 --> 00:16:13,792
No way.

188
00:16:18,759 --> 00:16:20,272
You really were stalling for time.

189
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,559
I'll get rid of you

190
00:16:21,639 --> 00:16:23,632
before I deal with them, you fraud!

191
00:16:37,799 --> 00:16:38,799
The back of his neck.

192
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,240
Are you hurt?

193
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:09,080
Zhen!

194
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:10,599
Zhen!

195
00:17:11,319 --> 00:17:12,792
Are you hurt, Zhen?

196
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,072
Little Fish! Little Fish!

197
00:17:16,359 --> 00:17:17,456
You were such a good fighter!

198
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:18,993
Why did you never tell me?

199
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:21,673
Commissioner Mei, that sword strike was amazing!

200
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:23,720
Where is my sword, Commissioner Mei?

201
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:28,200
Great, now I'm officially the weakest one in our family.

202
00:17:29,119 --> 00:17:31,560
Commissioner Mei, will you consider transfer to Jinwu Guards?

203
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:34,320
Will you consider joining us instead, Commissioner Mei?

204
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:35,976
- Commissioner Mei... - Little Fish...

205
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
I have to go.

206
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,800
Little Fish, I couldn't believe my eyes.

207
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,400
How did you do that?

208
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,552
Will you join us?

209
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,680
- Will you please join us? - Why didn't you ask me to join?

210
00:17:47,333 --> 00:17:49,720
Young Master, here's the Kirin Horn Gum.

211
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,873
Help! Help!

212
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:42,956
Take my advice and stay out of this! Go!

213
00:18:45,559 --> 00:18:46,752
If you save me,

214
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:49,040
I, Pei Ji Ya of Kunzhou, will serve at your command!

215
00:19:15,559 --> 00:19:16,559
Run!

216
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:55,640
With blood as the guide, heed my command.

217
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,560
He knows how to draw talismans.

218
00:20:13,079 --> 00:20:14,959
And his techniques are similar to my lifesaver.

219
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:20,073
Is Mei Zhu Yu also connected to Changxi Palace?

220
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,153
A demonic entity

221
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:12,513
should be exterminated.

222
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,153
But I will not kill you.

223
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:19,200
I know you never intended

224
00:21:19,799 --> 00:21:22,199
to harm the innocent during the Grand Aromatics Competition.

225
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:26,993
You chose An Bi Luo to make an example,

226
00:21:27,519 --> 00:21:31,240
to terrify them into ending their cruel slaughter for profit.

227
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:34,393
His crimes are numerous.

228
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,800
The law will deliver the punishment he deserves.

229
00:21:37,559 --> 00:21:40,552
Fear will haunt him every night from now on.

230
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:42,640
But you...

231
00:21:44,039 --> 00:21:45,312
If you cling to this hatred,

232
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:48,112
do you really wish to feed on resentment

233
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,512
for all eternity?

234
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:01,233
Stars of the Supreme Platform,

235
00:22:01,599 --> 00:22:02,913
shift without form.

236
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,592
Starlight, mirror-bright,

237
00:22:04,839 --> 00:22:06,153
bring peace to the six spirits.

238
00:22:06,839 --> 00:22:07,839
Disperse!

239
00:22:35,319 --> 00:22:36,319
It's you.

240
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:49,953
This... This is all An Bi Luo's doing?

241
00:22:50,759 --> 00:22:51,759
Yes.

242
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:56,913
All for his own selfish desire,

243
00:22:58,119 --> 00:22:59,873
he slaughtered so many innocent creatures.

244
00:23:00,359 --> 00:23:01,359
He's...

245
00:23:05,519 --> 00:23:06,832
What are you doing here?

246
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:11,080
I recalled what An Bi Luo said when he was possessed.

247
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:12,993
I followed those clues here.

248
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:16,393
This was his residence two months ago.

249
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,376
I suspected a connection to the competition.

250
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,400
So I came to take a look.

251
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:21,680
So did I.

252
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:23,960
But sadly...

253
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:26,993
All that's left are these remains.

254
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:28,760
Wrong.

255
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:53,312
Her Majesty was furious when she heard about what happened.

256
00:23:53,519 --> 00:23:55,856
She almost ordered the competition to be abolished entirely.

257
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:58,249
Consort Mei and Princess Yuan Zhen pleaded with her for quite a while

258
00:23:58,273 --> 00:24:00,186
until she finally changed her mind.

259
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:03,799
The Grand Aromatics Competition is an event for all the people.

260
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:06,400
It wouldn't be right to cancel it outright

261
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:07,832
just because of An Bi Luo.

262
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:10,153
So His Majesty decreed

263
00:24:10,279 --> 00:24:11,656
that from now on, no fragrance may be

264
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:13,896
made with ingredients from the cruel slaughter of animals,

265
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:15,760
nor may the blends be excessively lavish.

266
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:18,520
The winning scents should be ones common folk can afford.

267
00:24:19,319 --> 00:24:21,519
An Bi Luo has been expelled from the Fragrance Society.

268
00:24:22,039 --> 00:24:25,240
They say that not only did no one see him off when he left the city today,

269
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:28,080
a crowd was even throwing rotten vegetables at his carriage.

270
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,633
If this incident can break

271
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:34,200
the nobility's habit of spending fortunes

272
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:37,673
on fragrances,

273
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:42,080
prizing expense over actual quality,

274
00:24:43,519 --> 00:24:44,719
then some good has come of it.

275
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:47,240
Young Lady, you and Her Majesty are of one mind.

276
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:49,600
She's worried about you

277
00:24:49,839 --> 00:24:52,079
and asks that you visit the palace in the next few days.

278
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,352
Alright.

279
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:59,633
What should I call you?

280
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:03,193
A goose...

281
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:07,360
Goose, goose, goose...

282
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:08,792
Goose, goose, goose,

283
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:10,393
long neck stretching to the sky.

284
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:12,216
White feathers float as the river drifts by,

285
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,913
red paddles as the waters fly.

286
00:25:14,319 --> 00:25:17,240
Zhen, your poetic skills have taken a dive.

287
00:25:17,359 --> 00:25:19,640
Maybe I should bring you a children's primer to brush up.

288
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:21,953
Mind your own business.

289
00:25:22,119 --> 00:25:23,233
When did you get here?

290
00:25:23,552 --> 00:25:25,312
Right when you started reciting about geese.

291
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:30,470
Lady Wu is naming the goose.

292
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,393
Naming it?

293
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:35,352
What's next, giving it a eulogy when it goes in the stew?

294
00:25:35,799 --> 00:25:37,233
Watch your mouth.

295
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:39,114
You're scaring my Gooson.

296
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:40,813
Your son?

297
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,433
It's Gooson.

298
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,032
Its name.

299
00:25:45,552 --> 00:25:47,320
From now on, you're my Gooson.

300
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:49,720
Your son?

301
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:56,832
Guess who I am!

302
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:58,512
Can't see me, can you?

303
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:01,913
You can't see me!

304
00:26:07,087 --> 00:26:10,153
I picked up a new souvenir from my travels.

305
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,520
An invisibility cloak

306
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:16,153
sold to me by a master.

307
00:26:17,319 --> 00:26:20,433
You honestly believe that thing has any magic in it?

308
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:23,480
Never mind that for now.

309
00:26:24,119 --> 00:26:25,119
You...

310
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:28,713
I was gone only three months,

311
00:26:29,319 --> 00:26:31,393
and now I'm a grandfather?

312
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,552
That was fast.

313
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:37,920
You.

314
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
You.

315
00:26:40,519 --> 00:26:41,519
You.

316
00:26:44,279 --> 00:26:45,279
Who is the father?

317
00:26:48,359 --> 00:26:49,359
Uncle.

318
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:53,240
Duke Wu.

319
00:26:54,839 --> 00:26:56,713
I'm Mei Zhu Yu. Greetings, Duke Wu.

320
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:58,953
Good, good.

321
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:02,752
One I see often,

322
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:05,832
one I haven't seen in a long time,

323
00:27:06,359 --> 00:27:08,640
and one I'm meeting for the first time.

324
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,193
Good, good.

325
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:12,112
If you had been away any longer,

326
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,193
I would've thought I'd lost my father.

327
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:18,552
Well, I only heard that two gentlemen

328
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:21,439
had taken up residence in our manor.

329
00:27:21,519 --> 00:27:24,832
The gossip in Chang'an is simply riveting.

330
00:27:25,519 --> 00:27:26,953
People are even placing bets.

331
00:27:28,079 --> 00:27:30,752
Naturally, I was concerned.

332
00:27:33,079 --> 00:27:34,846
So you just came home for the drama.

333
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:38,753
No. I'm worried about my daughter.

334
00:27:40,039 --> 00:27:41,039
So...

335
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:42,880
Which...

336
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:46,312
Which one of these two is my future son-in-law?

337
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:48,072
Which one do you prefer, Father?

338
00:27:48,519 --> 00:27:49,519
Me?

339
00:27:53,079 --> 00:27:54,079
It's a tough choice.

340
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,153
Tough choice?

341
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:59,233
Look after your grandson first then.

342
00:28:04,119 --> 00:28:05,119
Zhen...

343
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:11,873
Young Master Mei,

344
00:28:12,519 --> 00:28:15,199
might I ask what your intentions are toward Zhen...

345
00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:16,279
Uncle.

346
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:19,721
Young Master Mei is only residing here on my account.

347
00:28:20,519 --> 00:28:21,953
And I have come to Chang'an

348
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,160
to formally ask for Zhen's hand in marriage.

349
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,640
I hope you will grant your consent.

350
00:28:46,759 --> 00:28:47,759
Zhen.

351
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:56,933
Is this about Liu Tai Zhen?

352
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:59,473
What's going on with Lady Liu?

353
00:28:59,559 --> 00:29:01,735
Why was it you who went to the competition instead of her?

354
00:29:01,759 --> 00:29:04,072
I thought I'd get to see her that day.

355
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:08,520
Why do you want to see her so badly?

356
00:29:08,839 --> 00:29:10,913
I've been copying the Compendium of Demons.

357
00:29:11,599 --> 00:29:13,272
I wanted to show her my drawings.

358
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:18,754
That day, it was Ling Xiao who invited me to the competition.

359
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:20,792
As for Liu Tai Zhen...

360
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:24,440
She fell ill.

361
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:25,680
She fell ill?

362
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:27,679
What illness? Is it serious? Is it bad?

363
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:29,432
Is it fatal? Has she seen a physician?

364
00:29:30,119 --> 00:29:32,079
Calm down. She's fine.

365
00:29:32,319 --> 00:29:34,393
She just isn't in Chang'an at the moment.

366
00:29:34,759 --> 00:29:35,792
She...

367
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:38,112
She should be back three days later.

368
00:29:40,039 --> 00:29:41,953
Three days later...

369
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:37,120
You were supposed to be a righteous cultivator.

370
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:40,473
Yet you're stealing the life essence of a rabbit demon with evil arts!

371
00:30:45,839 --> 00:30:48,120
Looks like another fresh prey has delivered itself to me.

372
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:24,873
(Get it done quickly. Don't meddle in anything else.)

373
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:29,560
I was only asking about a person.

374
00:31:30,039 --> 00:31:31,673
Must he be so impatient?

375
00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:35,832
What should we do now, Young Master?

376
00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:39,559
Never mind then.

377
00:31:40,119 --> 00:31:42,153
My lifesaver did teach me these arts

378
00:31:42,319 --> 00:31:43,319
to help me grow stronger.

379
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:45,080
Since he needs this done urgently,

380
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:46,953
we'll prioritize his task.

381
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:56,512
How could it be? That makes no sense.

382
00:31:57,119 --> 00:31:59,479
She looked perfectly fine to me.

383
00:31:59,559 --> 00:32:01,512
What are you mumbling about?

384
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:04,993
And stop pacing. You're making me dizzy.

385
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:07,360
Lady Liu didn't attend the Grand Aromatics Competition.

386
00:32:08,079 --> 00:32:09,079
So?

387
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:11,752
She seemed perfectly fine.

388
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:13,873
How could she suddenly fall sick?

389
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,239
You mortals have short lives.

390
00:32:16,319 --> 00:32:18,752
Catching an illness here and there is normal, isn't it?

391
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:23,013
I have a question.

392
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:25,512
Do you demons infest people's houses?

393
00:32:26,559 --> 00:32:28,136
We demons have our own business to attend to.

394
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:30,360
Why would we hang around in mortal homes for no reason?

395
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:31,873
Aren't you living in mine?

396
00:32:32,519 --> 00:32:34,095
I'm only staying to recover from my injuries.

397
00:32:34,119 --> 00:32:35,633
Special case. Got it?

398
00:32:36,119 --> 00:32:37,119
Fine, fine.

399
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:39,840
So what you're saying is, under special circumstances,

400
00:32:40,079 --> 00:32:42,153
you would infest someone's home?

401
00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:43,832
Obviously.

402
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:47,640
Listen,

403
00:32:48,039 --> 00:32:51,032
I saw a huge white serpent at Lady Liu's place.

404
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:53,152
A white serpent?

405
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:57,232
Its body was as thick as a barrel, about 30, 40 feet tall.

406
00:32:57,839 --> 00:33:00,752
A serpent that huge has to be a demon.

407
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:03,193
You don't think Lady Liu

408
00:33:03,319 --> 00:33:06,580
got sick because of that white serpent demon?

409
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:07,920
Well...

410
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:10,913
I'd have to see it to know for sure.

411
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:21,512
Let me get this straight.

412
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:23,400
So the Zhuan Fish demons at the hot springs

413
00:33:23,759 --> 00:33:25,673
and the little demons at the massage parlor

414
00:33:26,119 --> 00:33:27,512
are fighting over business?

415
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:32,193
I heard a lot had been happening at your manor lately.

416
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:34,416
It's been a while since you last came to Demon City.

417
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:36,873
There are some matters I'm unsure how to handle.

418
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,560
I was hoping for your perspective.

419
00:33:39,119 --> 00:33:40,953
There are things you can't handle?

420
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:44,400
And here I thought you were brilliantly clever

421
00:33:44,593 --> 00:33:45,705
and capable of anything.

422
00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:50,279
Hang on.

423
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:51,993
Why does this sound familiar?

424
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,713
I think Hu Zhu mentioned this to me before.

425
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:58,072
Wasn't it something that happened ages ago?

426
00:33:58,880 --> 00:33:59,880
Maybe

427
00:34:00,599 --> 00:34:01,919
they've started squabbling again.

428
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:14,200
Here are the ledgers from the hot springs and massage parlor

429
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:15,433
Go over them with me,

430
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:17,833
let's see where the problem lies.

431
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:21,833
I hate ledgers.

432
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:24,033
Numbers give me a headache.

433
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:35,040
(Liu Residence)

434
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:42,273
It's getting late. Why isn't she back?

435
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,000
Loach!

436
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:52,913
What are you doing, Master Snake?

437
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:55,873
Since she won't be back anytime soon,

438
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:57,840
and they won't let you into the manor,

439
00:34:58,079 --> 00:34:59,479
what's the point of waiting around?

440
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:01,433
Might as well take me for a stroll.

441
00:35:01,679 --> 00:35:04,192
I've been cooped up in your place so long. It's been boring.

442
00:35:04,519 --> 00:35:05,632
Where do you want to go?

443
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:06,993
Someplace with food.

444
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:08,966
Food for you?

445
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:11,321
You're smaller than a flatbread! What could you even eat?

446
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:20,032
Stop! Alright, alright! I'm taking you there now!

447
00:35:22,039 --> 00:35:23,039
We're going now.

448
00:35:27,039 --> 00:35:30,433
Master Snake, in Chang'an you'll find not only local specialties,

449
00:35:30,519 --> 00:35:33,359
but exotic flavors from the Western Regions and Southern Frontiers too.

450
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:36,592
Up ahead, there's mutton soup and ox intestine sausages.

451
00:35:36,913 --> 00:35:38,993
And of course, my personal favorite, layered pastry.

452
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:42,560
And this stall here has great wine-marinated chicken.

453
00:35:45,079 --> 00:35:46,479
- Master Snake? - Come again.

454
00:35:46,559 --> 00:35:48,639
- Master Snake? - Come again!

455
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:51,240
Where does this loach come from?

456
00:35:56,559 --> 00:35:58,639
Oh... Boss.

457
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:00,440
Boss, I'll take this one.

458
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:03,999
I just saw a loach crawl over it.

459
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:05,119
How about another one?

460
00:36:05,199 --> 00:36:06,512
No, I want this one.

461
00:36:08,199 --> 00:36:09,199
Alright then.

462
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:13,079
- Here you go. - Thank you.

463
00:36:13,159 --> 00:36:14,159
Come again!

464
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:16,119
Master Snake, are you alright?

465
00:36:16,199 --> 00:36:17,552
He hit me on the head.

466
00:36:18,159 --> 00:36:19,720
He actually smacked me with a skimmer!

467
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:20,959
Count yourself lucky.

468
00:36:21,039 --> 00:36:22,879
Didn't you see he had a knife in his hand too?

469
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:31,472
What shop is this?

470
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:33,192
Why is it so dark here?

471
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:35,712
It's an ink shop. They sell ink here.

472
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:40,714
This doesn't suit my tastes at all.

473
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:43,313
It's not for eating.

474
00:36:43,547 --> 00:36:44,940
It's for painting.

475
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:46,480
Painting?

476
00:36:47,159 --> 00:36:48,273
Ah, I see.

477
00:36:48,519 --> 00:36:51,072
This black stuff is meant for painting me, isn't it?

478
00:36:52,559 --> 00:36:55,072
Not that they could ever capture my true magnificence.

479
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:58,533
I ran out of ink at home. I'm here to buy some good ones.

480
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,200
- Boss! - Coming!

481
00:37:05,199 --> 00:37:07,029
Young Master Mei, it's been a while.

482
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:08,810
I want some top-grade storax ink sticks.

483
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:10,813
Ah, bad timing.

484
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:13,980
A wealthy patron bought up all the good ink a few days ago.

485
00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:15,900
All of it?

486
00:37:16,119 --> 00:37:17,119
Yes.

487
00:37:17,239 --> 00:37:19,119
Normally, I'm lucky to sell an ounce in months,

488
00:37:19,199 --> 00:37:21,080
but this time, he cleared me out completely.

489
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:24,632
If only I'd stocked up more.

490
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:26,393
But I need ink urgently.

491
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:32,760
Please wait a moment.

492
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:38,913
If you're interested, you could try this.

493
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:41,353
Someone left it here on consignment.

494
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:48,592
Look at it, smooth texture, glossy sheen, like polished lacquer.

495
00:37:49,079 --> 00:37:51,913
This is absolutely top-quality.

496
00:37:54,639 --> 00:37:55,833
Premium ink?

497
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:56,960
No doubt about it.

498
00:37:57,199 --> 00:37:58,672
This is better than storax ink.

499
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:02,079
- I'll take it. - Alright!

500
00:38:07,199 --> 00:38:09,393
- Thank you! - Come again, Young Master Mei.

501
00:39:06,039 --> 00:39:08,152
Lord Qiang Yi.

502
00:39:08,559 --> 00:39:10,753
I finally got to spend time with her today.

503
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:13,994
You're only a fractured soul.

504
00:39:14,639 --> 00:39:16,320
I would not allow anyone to disturb us,

505
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:18,440
not even if the Heavenly Emperor himself descended.
