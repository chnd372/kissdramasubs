00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:30,969
(Moonlit Reunion)

2
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:33,920
(Episode 17)

3
00:01:34,008 --> 00:01:36,760
(Mei Residence)

4
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,325
Loach.

5
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:47,880
I am not a loach.

6
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,560
I bought you fried loach anyway.

7
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,286
White Serpent told me

8
00:01:53,879 --> 00:01:57,520
a small demon needs to eat its kind to recover.

9
00:01:59,703 --> 00:02:00,960
It is as big as you.

10
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,245
How do you eat it?

11
00:02:02,818 --> 00:02:05,000
I don't care. Deal with it yourself.

12
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:09,160
How many times do I have to tell you?

13
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,798
I am a Black Snake!

14
00:02:11,878 --> 00:02:13,560
Yes. Forget it if you don't want it.

15
00:02:14,039 --> 00:02:15,200
I'll eat it instead.

16
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:24,765
This is premium ink.

17
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,325
Thankfully, you didn't break it.

18
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:36,765
Premium ink like this is suitable for drawing.

19
00:02:37,038 --> 00:02:39,325
I'm going to draw an illustration book of demons

20
00:02:39,479 --> 00:02:40,679
for Lady Liu

21
00:02:40,759 --> 00:02:41,925
as a gift.

22
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,645
The demons you know

23
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:47,765
all come from the "Compendium of Demons" on the table.

24
00:02:48,439 --> 00:02:49,966
Everything has been recorded.

25
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,045
What else can you draw?

26
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:55,433
You are just copying and adding some elements.

27
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,526
You know nothing.

28
00:02:57,159 --> 00:02:58,839
This is the most complete book

29
00:02:58,919 --> 00:03:00,406
that has records of demons.

30
00:03:00,759 --> 00:03:02,846
You see me, a Black Snake, as a loach.

31
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:05,806
It's obvious that this book isn't good.

32
00:03:06,144 --> 00:03:09,831
- You...   - Demons are nurtured by Heaven and Earth.

33
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,205
It has many varieties.

34
00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:13,799
There are still many kinds

35
00:03:13,879 --> 00:03:16,165
that mortals haven't heard of or seen before.

36
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:18,325
Unlike a big demon like me.

37
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,485
You are a big demon?

38
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:25,120
You must be knowledgeable and know everything.

39
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,765
I don't want you to keep asking me questions. It's annoying.

40
00:03:28,671 --> 00:03:31,205
I'll just tell you some stories

41
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:34,205
to repay you for taking care of me.

42
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,519
Sure. Tell me slowly.

43
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:38,045
I'll draw them while you tell me.

44
00:04:10,952 --> 00:04:12,637
Tigers are the kings of the mountains.

45
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,566
Today, I will tell you

46
00:04:14,919 --> 00:04:18,166
about a tiger demon that gained its form after cultivating for 1,000 years.

47
00:04:20,199 --> 00:04:24,046
The tiger has saw-like teeth and a fierce glare.

48
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,405
It cultivates fire spells

49
00:04:25,879 --> 00:04:28,366
so there's a fire mark on its forehead.

50
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:31,006
It is three feet tall.

51
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:35,486
When its powers grow, it can turn into a demon that's eight feet tall.

52
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,885
When does its power grow?

53
00:04:40,439 --> 00:04:41,445
When its Life Gate,

54
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:43,726
the area between its eyebrows, is attacked.

55
00:04:45,639 --> 00:04:46,885
I see.

56
00:05:01,399 --> 00:05:02,445
How is it going?

57
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:06,879
The mighty Tiger Demon

58
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:08,606
that dominates a mountain

59
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:10,799
appeared like this in your drawing?

60
00:05:10,879 --> 00:05:13,285
Overall, it still looks good.

61
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,046
It's special.

62
00:05:30,519 --> 00:05:31,525
What do you think?

63
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,765
It's not bad.

64
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,645
It's lifelike.

65
00:06:38,959 --> 00:06:40,765
No wonder I think the ink is weird.

66
00:06:41,279 --> 00:06:42,965
It actually contains an evil spell.

67
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:48,006
It can cause trouble for Demon City now.

68
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,046
This is bad.

69
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,085
It doesn't have a demon core?

70
00:08:36,975 --> 00:08:40,709
(Duke Wu's Residence)

71
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:51,846
Brother Mei!

72
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:02,405
I haven't seen you in the Arcane Appraisal Bureau recently.

73
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,446
I've heard many rumors.

74
00:09:06,759 --> 00:09:09,126
I don't even know

75
00:09:09,679 --> 00:09:11,246
which of them is true.

76
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,565
What did you hear?

77
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,885
People are talking in the city.

78
00:09:21,759 --> 00:09:22,885
Sometimes,

79
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:26,405
they say you were chased out of Chang'an by Princess Qinghe.

80
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:31,726
Sometimes, they say Princess Qinghe has a new man.

81
00:09:32,919 --> 00:09:33,920
Sometimes, they also say

82
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,446
there are two men who volunteer to stay in this residence.

83
00:09:37,879 --> 00:09:39,880
They appear like melons in the summer.

84
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,606
One after another.

85
00:09:41,879 --> 00:09:43,446
Round after round.

86
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,045
Before I could comprehend the previous stories,

87
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,206
well,

88
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:49,565
I heard news about the Grand Aromatics Competition.

89
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,885
They say the powerful Mr. Mei

90
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,246
saved the princess.

91
00:09:54,639 --> 00:09:55,645
When I think about it,

92
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,246
someone as excellent,

93
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:01,285
must not be Fourth Master Mei.

94
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:04,326
Enough. Stop talking.

95
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,006
Why are you looking for me so early in the morning?

96
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,246
Something's wrong.

97
00:10:08,639 --> 00:10:09,645
Something serious.

98
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:30,525
Mr. Mei, this case is a little troublesome indeed.

99
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:22,726
This...

100
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:30,925
These are...

101
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:50,006
Little Loach!

102
00:11:50,559 --> 00:11:51,726
What is it?

103
00:11:52,519 --> 00:11:54,326
The whole place is stained with blood.

104
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:01,925
It turns into ink?

105
00:12:02,159 --> 00:12:03,606
There's no blood.

106
00:12:04,159 --> 00:12:06,246
You probably made a mistake because you didn't sleep well.

107
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,846
Little Loach, look at my painting.

108
00:12:10,519 --> 00:12:12,000
The Tiger Demon's ink has become pale.

109
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:14,006
Perhaps you didn't grind your ink well.

110
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,157
Impossible. I've ground ink since I was young.

111
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:17,559
There's no problem with the ink.

112
00:12:17,639 --> 00:12:18,880
Are you questioning me?

113
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:19,966
I...

114
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,606
I'm not.

115
00:12:22,879 --> 00:12:24,925
Do you still want to hear stories about other demons?

116
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,285
I do.

117
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,120
Today, we'll be talking about

118
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:40,925
the legendary Pomegranate Demon, Pi Ning.

119
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:44,966
Its head was a pomegranate.

120
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:49,405
However, it pretends to be a pretty girl during the day.

121
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,525
It uses its long hair to cover its head.

122
00:12:53,559 --> 00:12:55,885
When it fights, it shakes its head violently

123
00:12:56,039 --> 00:12:57,405
and shake its hair away.

124
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:02,640
The countless pomegranate seeds

125
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:03,805
are used as darts.

126
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:06,206
They are the best throwing weapon.

127
00:13:09,727 --> 00:13:11,812
It shakes its head while fighting?

128
00:13:12,559 --> 00:13:15,165
Little Loach, are you not lying to me?

129
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,486
Why would I lie to you?

130
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,920
It looks like that thing in the mortal realm.

131
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,525
What is it again?

132
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:22,846
Rattle drum.

133
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:39,486
I also fought a Deer Demon once.

134
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:42,719
Its eyes grew on its back.

135
00:13:42,799 --> 00:13:44,565
The eyes looked everywhere

136
00:13:44,967 --> 00:13:46,572
and could see everything.

137
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:50,045
The four antlers on its head were very sharp.

138
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:53,486
I heard it likes to rub its antlers on poisonous tree bark.

139
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:55,966
After a long time,

140
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:57,925
its antlers became extremely poisonous

141
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:59,846
with poison that was hard to cure.

142
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,565
In this world,

143
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:08,206
plants and animals aren't the only things that can demonify.

144
00:14:08,919 --> 00:14:10,565
When an object comes in contact with blood,

145
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:12,606
it can kill as well.

146
00:14:14,216 --> 00:14:15,255
There's a demon

147
00:14:15,336 --> 00:14:19,263
that is born from a jade die of a gambling den.

148
00:14:19,759 --> 00:14:21,006
One day,

149
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24,325
someone lost a lot of money in the gambling den

150
00:14:24,405 --> 00:14:26,119
and started swinging his blade and killing people.

151
00:14:26,985 --> 00:14:29,285
Blood splattered on the die

152
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,126
and it became evil.

153
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,846
The Die Devil might be small

154
00:14:34,159 --> 00:14:35,765
but it is very cruel.

155
00:14:36,559 --> 00:14:39,839
Its six sides have 21 eyes in total

156
00:14:39,919 --> 00:14:41,446
and every eye is blood red.

157
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:45,366
The more blood it sees, the more it gets excited.

158
00:14:46,519 --> 00:14:49,446
I remember a temple

159
00:14:49,679 --> 00:14:51,165
that has been abandoned for many years.

160
00:14:51,639 --> 00:14:54,405
There's a broken water jar in the yard.

161
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,086
It cannot hold water

162
00:14:57,639 --> 00:15:00,160
but it moves with the wind through its cracks

163
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:04,885
and uses the wind as its attacks.

164
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:12,045
The sky is full of stars but the moon cannot be seen.

165
00:15:12,759 --> 00:15:15,685
There are many mysterious incidents on land.

166
00:15:16,519 --> 00:15:19,206
Last night,

167
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:21,880
a demon appeared in Chang'an.

168
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:23,920
It has the form of smoke and ink

169
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,446
and it can change into many shapes.

170
00:15:30,519 --> 00:15:33,925
It seems like the people of Chang'an will be terrified now.

171
00:15:38,559 --> 00:15:40,846
Have you heard? There are demons in Chang'an.

172
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,405
The wine seller said it was a Pig Demon.

173
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,640
Nonsense. It was a Fox Demon.

174
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,880
Excuse me. Where did you hear

175
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:48,285
the stories of demons?

176
00:15:48,799 --> 00:15:50,925
Many people are talking about it in the city.

177
00:15:51,159 --> 00:15:53,126
- Let's go.   - Who are you calling a pig?

178
00:15:53,351 --> 00:15:54,719
You are a flying pig.

179
00:15:54,799 --> 00:15:56,086
Everyone in your family is a pig.

180
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:00,045
Brother Mei, what were you talking about?

181
00:16:03,039 --> 00:16:04,765
Many people in Chang'an

182
00:16:04,991 --> 00:16:06,679
have started talking about the demons.

183
00:16:06,759 --> 00:16:07,765
No way.

184
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:10,525
We have been ordering the people

185
00:16:10,679 --> 00:16:11,966
not to tell other people

186
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,805
to prevent them from panicking.

187
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,525
News of it has spread so much in less than a day.

188
00:16:17,879 --> 00:16:19,846
This isn't just a simple rumor.

189
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:22,846
Brother Mei, are you saying

190
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:25,645
that someone is fueling the rumors?

191
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,366
It's possible.

192
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:30,640
Brother Mei, do you want me

193
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,366
to check the registration of the ink shop?

194
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:36,405
The key to the traces is ink.

195
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,685
The power of the ink isn't a kind of demonic power

196
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,685
but a kind of evil spell indeed.

197
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,846
Evil spell?

198
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:45,565
What is it?

199
00:16:46,879 --> 00:16:49,486
Have you heard about the suppression technique?

200
00:16:50,159 --> 00:16:51,165
No.

201
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,959
Simply speaking, it's an illegal spell.

202
00:16:54,039 --> 00:16:56,079
The spell caster doesn't learn it from cultivation

203
00:16:56,159 --> 00:16:59,045
but from sacrificing his own body.

204
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:03,405
Brother Mei, how do you know it's the suppression technique?

205
00:17:03,559 --> 00:17:04,565
Right.

206
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:07,759
Every demon will turn into its original form after dying.

207
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:09,605
It will never vanish for no reason.

208
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:12,045
If there's no body, it's not a demon.

209
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,686
That's how suppression technique works.

210
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:15,640
They assimilate their conscience

211
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:17,166
into an external object

212
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:19,646
to achieve the goal of controlling that object.

213
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:21,560
The traces left behind by the tiger's death

214
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:23,406
are the manifestation of the suppression technique.

215
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,686
I see.

216
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:27,966
Can I have it now?

217
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:31,805
Here you go.

218
00:17:35,279 --> 00:17:38,006
How do we investigate the spell caster?

219
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:40,166
Should we start from the ink shop?

220
00:17:41,559 --> 00:17:43,926
Right now, we can only use this stupid method.

221
00:17:45,015 --> 00:17:47,000
(Ink Workshop)

222
00:17:52,322 --> 00:17:54,126
The Arcane Appraisal Bureau is investigating a case.

223
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,726
Please show me your ledger.

224
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:02,080
The ledger is my shop's secret.

225
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,365
Your bureau can't...

226
00:18:05,759 --> 00:18:08,045
Sure. Please come with me.

227
00:18:10,519 --> 00:18:12,605
The Arcane Appraisal Bureau? I don't want to go there.

228
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:14,325
I'll show it to you. Please wait.

229
00:18:19,079 --> 00:18:20,085
Please take a look.

230
00:18:38,367 --> 00:18:40,508
(Purchased by Fourth Master Mei)

231
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,006
Take care.

232
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,166
Boss.

233
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:06,720
Show me the ledger that you showed him just now.

234
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,246
Which bureau are you from?

235
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:12,479
My ledger isn't anything special.

236
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:14,120
Why is everyone trying to look at it?

237
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,206
Move!

238
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,246
Here you go.

239
00:19:21,519 --> 00:19:23,325
Take your time.

240
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:24,845
This one.

241
00:19:28,367 --> 00:19:30,332
(Mei Residence)

242
00:19:31,743 --> 00:19:32,749
Fourth Brother!

243
00:19:36,359 --> 00:19:37,365
Fourth Brother!

244
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:40,246
Fourth Brother!

245
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:42,486
Fourth Brother!

246
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:48,486
Fourth Brother!

247
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:49,646
Fourth Brother!

248
00:19:52,359 --> 00:19:54,926
(The Ink Demons in Chang'an actually came from these paintings.)

249
00:20:02,079 --> 00:20:03,085
Fourth Brother!

250
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:05,486
Get up!

251
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:06,926
Enough! Get up!

252
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:08,486
Fourth Brother!

253
00:20:11,599 --> 00:20:12,605
Come!

254
00:20:24,727 --> 00:20:26,059
- Move!   - Stop!

255
00:20:26,143 --> 00:20:27,507
Don't come near if you want to save him!

256
00:21:16,599 --> 00:21:17,646
Fourth Master!

257
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:19,886
How are you?

258
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:23,166
Little Fish?

259
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,006
Are you awake now?

260
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,206
Why am I here?

261
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:30,246
What happened to me?

262
00:21:57,599 --> 00:21:59,446
Why did you kick the table for no reason?

263
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,045
No. It wasn't me.

264
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:05,246
Didn't you see something pass by?

265
00:22:06,039 --> 00:22:07,045
What?

266
00:22:07,759 --> 00:22:09,006
You must have made a mistake.

267
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,246
I'm talking to you.

268
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,446
What are you looking at?

269
00:22:20,119 --> 00:22:21,686
I'm not in the sky.

270
00:22:22,119 --> 00:22:23,525
Why are you looking at the sky?

271
00:22:23,717 --> 00:22:24,941
What did you say?

272
00:22:26,519 --> 00:22:27,726
I want to ask you

273
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:31,406
who you like

274
00:22:31,799 --> 00:22:33,085
between Mr. Mei and Mr. Pei.

275
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:35,800
You purposely summoned me into the palace

276
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:37,279
just to talk about this?

277
00:22:37,359 --> 00:22:38,805
Mr. Mei

278
00:22:39,279 --> 00:22:41,239
risked everything to save you.

279
00:22:41,319 --> 00:22:42,686
He's indeed a nice person.

280
00:22:43,079 --> 00:22:44,805
However, his family background isn't suitable.

281
00:22:45,759 --> 00:22:48,085
Pei Ji Ya has a suitable family background

282
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,365
and he is also your childhood friend.

283
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,765
Unfortunately, if you marry him,

284
00:22:53,519 --> 00:22:55,406
you will probably have to move to Kunzhou.

285
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:00,525
Be patient.

286
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:03,166
Choosing a husband is an important event in life.

287
00:23:04,119 --> 00:23:05,959
She needs to think about it seriously.

288
00:23:06,039 --> 00:23:08,045
There's no time to pick slowly.

289
00:23:09,119 --> 00:23:10,125
Zhen.

290
00:23:10,519 --> 00:23:13,085
You have grown up. You should get married.

291
00:23:13,319 --> 00:23:14,325
If you wait longer,

292
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:16,565
no one will want you anymore.

293
00:23:16,839 --> 00:23:17,999
If I don't meet

294
00:23:18,079 --> 00:23:20,085
the person I want to be with forever,

295
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:22,966
I can still live a good life alone.

296
00:23:25,279 --> 00:23:26,285
Where are you going?

297
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:28,166
I'm not done yet.

298
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:31,560
You're always repeating the same thing.

299
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:33,565
My ears are going to bleed soon.

300
00:23:34,359 --> 00:23:37,246
If I don't find the man who is suitable for me,

301
00:23:37,359 --> 00:23:38,726
I won't get married.

302
00:23:39,799 --> 00:23:40,805
You...

303
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:48,605
Sister, calm down.

304
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:50,239
I'm busy

305
00:23:50,319 --> 00:23:51,686
so I'll be going back.

306
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:56,765
Look at her.

307
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:57,886
Look at her.

308
00:23:58,319 --> 00:24:00,045
She's always fooling around.

309
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,085
Calm down.

310
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:24,125
Come and have a look at this.

311
00:24:42,079 --> 00:24:43,406
- Can I try it?   - Sure.

312
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:52,285
I'll try it next time.

313
00:25:17,119 --> 00:25:18,125
Aunt Wu Zhen.

314
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:20,166
Be careful.

315
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:27,525
I'm telling him that you have come to the palace today.

316
00:25:28,599 --> 00:25:29,726
What did he say?

317
00:25:30,039 --> 00:25:32,845
He thanks you for treating him last time.

318
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:34,365
Seriously?

319
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,926
Isn't the tree swaying because of the wind?

320
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:41,605
Why can't I hear anything?

321
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:18,966
Aunt Wu Zhen!

322
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,160
Loach, I'll protect you.

323
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,365
Stay in my arms.

324
00:27:02,079 --> 00:27:03,406
It's just an Ink Demon.

325
00:27:03,599 --> 00:27:05,486
I don't need you to protect me.

326
00:27:14,416 --> 00:27:16,320
(My powers haven't restored yet.)

327
00:27:16,614 --> 00:27:17,880
(It's terrible.)

328
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:38,966
Aunt Wu Zhen!

329
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:23,646
Is it you, Hua?

330
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:26,686
Don't be afraid.

331
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:28,246
I'm here.

332
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:30,045
No!

333
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:51,646
Hua!

334
00:30:13,119 --> 00:30:14,125
Hua!

335
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:15,246
Hua!

336
00:30:17,065 --> 00:30:18,120
Hua!

337
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:19,206
Hua!

338
00:30:19,559 --> 00:30:20,565
Hua!

339
00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:21,805
Hua!

340
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:23,726
Hua!

341
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:26,726
Hua!

342
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,006
Hua!

343
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:34,166
Your Highness.

344
00:30:38,079 --> 00:30:39,085
Hua.

345
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:42,646
What have you done?

346
00:30:46,279 --> 00:30:47,525
Your Highness, thank you

347
00:30:49,759 --> 00:30:51,325
for giving me a name.

348
00:30:53,519 --> 00:30:55,486
I am Yuan Zhen. What about you?

349
00:30:58,359 --> 00:30:59,446
I have no name.

350
00:31:00,111 --> 00:31:01,117
That's impossible.

351
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:02,519
Everyone in this world

352
00:31:02,599 --> 00:31:04,206
should have their own name.

353
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,125
But I'm not a human.

354
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:11,686
Camellia.

355
00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:14,285
Hua.

356
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:16,080
Your name will be Hua,

357
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:17,166
all right?

358
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:19,406
Hua?

359
00:31:36,799 --> 00:31:38,565
I was a wilting tree.

360
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:42,045
Flowers only bloomed

361
00:31:42,839 --> 00:31:44,285
after I met you.

362
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:47,966
Hua.

363
00:31:50,599 --> 00:31:51,605
Hua.

364
00:31:53,599 --> 00:31:54,605
Hua!

365
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,206
Hua!

366
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:00,446
Hua!

367
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:03,726
Hua!

368
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:06,726
Hua!

369
00:32:40,711 --> 00:32:42,640
(The Ink Demons have spread all over the city.)

370
00:32:43,119 --> 00:32:45,085
(I must first lure them out of Chang'an.)

371
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:09,285
They are here so soon.

372
00:35:18,159 --> 00:35:19,165
Young Master.

373
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:21,920
The Ink Demons are gone.

374
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,205
That's impossible.

375
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:25,605
If Benefactor finds out

376
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:28,486
I failed to do what he ordered...

377
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:32,806
Young Master!

378
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:36,766
Which part did it go wrong?

379
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:04,645
Boss, the Ink Demons have appeared in the city again.

380
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:06,326
Did you see them in the day?

381
00:36:06,719 --> 00:36:07,840
I did.

382
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:09,125
However, there's no need to worry.

383
00:36:09,759 --> 00:36:11,434
I asked you to investigate the Western market.

384
00:36:11,519 --> 00:36:12,645
Did you find anything?

385
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,446
I probably

386
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,685
know where the Ink Demons come from.

387
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:29,446
Si!

388
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:38,846
Si?

389
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,205
Why are you here?

390
00:37:48,808 --> 00:37:50,033
I'm here to see Fourth Brother.

391
00:37:53,229 --> 00:37:54,605
I'm here to visit your fourth brother.

392
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:00,926
I heard you beat Si up.

393
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:03,406
His mental state was unusual.

394
00:38:03,679 --> 00:38:04,966
I only helped him wake up.

395
00:38:06,119 --> 00:38:07,205
His mental state was unusual?

396
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,366
Why?

397
00:38:14,239 --> 00:38:15,245
Suppression technique.

398
00:38:16,519 --> 00:38:17,766
Suppression technique?

399
00:38:18,239 --> 00:38:19,326
What are you two doing?

400
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:22,685
Why are you two here?

401
00:38:23,559 --> 00:38:24,565
Where did you go?

402
00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:26,920
I was scolded by Father.

403
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,400
He said I got possessed

404
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:30,966
because I didn't study well and only read strange books.

405
00:38:32,437 --> 00:38:34,443
How did you know that Si was possessed,

406
00:38:34,719 --> 00:38:35,966
Mr. Mei?

407
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:39,489
I came to visit him by chance

408
00:38:39,611 --> 00:38:41,101
and realized something was wrong with him.

409
00:38:42,239 --> 00:38:43,245
That's right.

410
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:45,605
Is the ink you use to draw still around?

411
00:38:46,719 --> 00:38:47,725
Let me take a look.

412
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:53,840
It's probably finished.

413
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:54,920
Since you're fine,

414
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,006
I'll be leaving.

415
00:38:57,039 --> 00:38:58,045
Take care.

416
00:39:03,159 --> 00:39:04,165
What's wrong?

417
00:39:04,559 --> 00:39:06,685
Lady Wu Zhen, can you leave with me?

418
00:39:16,199 --> 00:39:17,760
Si, I'll be leaving as well.

419
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:18,960
Sure, Miss Zhen.
